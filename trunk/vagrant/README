The purpose of this vagrant machine is to provide the following:

  1) xterm with gnu command line, tmuxinator, byobu
  2) provide a linux dev environment
  3) provide basic web server with php/python/etc support

So far the pupose has not been to replace a full java dev environment although it could:

  1) eclipse

The idea is that someone bringing up this vagrant box would have a directory structure like this:

  C:/dev/andersonbd1 - https://code.google.com/p/andersonbd1/
  C:/dev/ns/aa-uidd-db - https://git.nexgen.neustar.biz/neustar/aa-uid-db
  C:/dev/ns/scripts - https://git.nexgen.neustar.biz/ben.anderson/bens_random_ns_code/tree/master/scripts
  C:/Users/banderso/Google Drive - my google drive

It gets somewhat confusing because I previously created a vagrant box for neustar development.  The 
purpose of that box was to provide a similar system as production (centos6) to:

  1) build the rpm
  2) test my upstart scripts
  3) provide aerospike and postgres for dev

Notes on manual steps needed after automated provisioning:

  # login using metacity to avoid compiz's high cpu issue

  # asks for password
    - click the gear in the top right
      - "Security & Privacy"
        - uncheck "Waking from suspend" and "Returning from blank screen"

  #terminal is dusty grey instead of black
  Edit->Profile Preferences
    Colors tab
      Built-in schemes: Linux console

TODO:

  - run eclipse
  - multiple monitors
  - ctlr-c, ctlr-v, middle click
