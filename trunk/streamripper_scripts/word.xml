	Our example sentence uses &quot;touchstone&quot; in its most recently acquired sense: &quot;a fundamental part.&quot; The earlier sense, &quot;a criterion for quality&quot; (as in &quot;<em>I Love Lucy</em> is often seen as a touchstone for comparison with today's TV comedy shows&quot;), provides a better clue to the original meaning of &quot;touchstone,&quot; however. The &quot;criterion&quot; sense, which goes back more than 470 years, alludes to a method of testing the purity of a sample of gold. The sample was rubbed on a piece of dark quartz or jasper -- the &quot;touchstone.&quot; The mark it made was compared to adjacent rubbings on the touchstone from gold of known purity. This method has proved accurate enough that touchstones are still used by jewelers today.

1 : a test or criterion for determining the quality or genuineness of a thing *2 : a fundamental or quintessential part or feature 

Example sentence:

Our example sentence uses "touchstone" in its most recently acquired sense: "a fundamental part." The earlier sense, "a criterion for quality" (as in "I Love Lucy is often seen as a touchstone for comparison with today's TV comedy shows"), provides a better clue to the original meaning of "touchstone," however. The "criterion" sense, which goes back more than 470 years, alludes to a method of testing the purity of a sample of gold. The sample was rubbed on a piece of dark quartz or jasper -- the "touchstone." The mark it made was compared to adjacent rubbings on the touchstone from gold of known purity. This method has proved accurate enough that touchstones are still used by jewelers today.

	&quot;Lothario&quot; comes from <em>The Fair Penitent</em> (1703), a tragedy by Nicholas Rowe. In the play, Lothario is a notorious seducer, extremely attractive but beneath his charming exterior a haughty and unfeeling scoundrel. He seduces Calista, an unfaithful wife and later the fair penitent of the title. After the play was published, the character of Lothario became a stock figure in English literature. For example, Samuel Richardson modeled the character of Lovelace on Lothario in his 1748 novel <em>Clarissa</em>. As the character became well known, his name became progressively more generic, and since the 18th century the word &quot;lothario&quot; has been used for a foppish, unscrupulous rake.<br /><br />

Cipriani created the dish for the Countess Amalia Nani Mocenigo, who had been under doctor&#146;s orders to avoid cooked meats.

	&quot;Officinal&quot; is a word applied in medicine to plants and herbs that are used in medicinal preparations.

"For a farewell to our jurisprudent, I wish unto him the gladsome light of jurisprudence. . . ." With this valedictory to English jurist Sir Thomas Littleton, another jurist, Sir Edward Coke, welcomed two new words into English. In 1628, his "jurisprudence" meant "knowledge of or skill in law," a now archaic sense that reflects the literal meaning of the word. "Jurisprudence" goes back to Latin "prudentia juris" (literally "skill in law"), from which was derived the Late Latin formation "jurisprudentia," and subsequently our word. The noun "jurisprudent" means "one skilled in law" -- in other words, "a jurist." There's also "jurisprude," a 20th-century back- formation created from "jurisprudence" with influence from "prude." It means "one who makes ostentatious show of jurisprudential learning."

	The Hebrew ancestor of the word &quot;golem&quot; meant &quot;shapeless mass,&quot; and the original golems started as lumps of clay that were formed into figures and brought to life by means of a charm or a combination of letters forming a sacred word. In the Middle Ages, golems were thought to be the perfect servants; their only fault was that they were sometimes too literal or mechanical in fulfilling their masters' orders. In the 16th century, the golem was thought of as a protector of the Jews in times of persecution. But by the late 1800s, &quot;golem&quot; had acquired a less friendly second sense, referring to a man-made monster that inspired many of the back-from-the-dead creations of classic horror fiction.

"Every tone was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains. The hearing of those wild notes always depressed my spirit, and filled me with ineffable sadness," wrote Frederick Douglass in his autobiography. Reading Douglass's words, it's easy to see that "ineffable" means "indescribable" or "unspeakable." And when we break down the word to its Latin roots, it's easy to see how those meanings came about. "Ineffable" comes from "ineffabilis," which joins the prefix "in-," meaning "not," with the adjective "effabilis," meaning "capable of being expressed." "Effabilis" comes from "effari" ("to speak out"), which in turn comes from "ex-" and "fari" ("to speak").
