 CONGREGATION FOR THE DOCTRINE OF THE FAITH </P>
</FONT>
  <p align="center"><b><i><font face="Times" size="4">LETTER TO THE BISHOPS OF
  THE CATHOLIC CHURCH <BR>ON THE PASTORAL CARE OF HOMOSEXUAL PERSONS</font></i></b></p>
<FONT FACE="Times" size=3>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">1. The issue of homosexuality and the moral evaluation of
homosexual acts have increasingly become a matter of public debate, even in
Catholic circles. Since this debate often advances arguments and makes
assertions inconsistent with the teaching of the Catholic Church, it is quite
rightly a cause for concern to all engaged in the pastoral ministry, and this
Congregation has judged it to be of sufficiently grave and widespread importance
to address to the Bishops of the Catholic Church this Letter on the Pastoral
Care of Homosexual Persons.</p>
<p align="left">2. Naturally, an exhaustive treatment of this complex issue
cannot be attempted here, but we will focus our reflection within the
distinctive context of the Catholic moral perspective. It is a perspective which
finds support in the more secure findings of the natural sciences, which have
their own legitimate and proper methodology and field of inquiry.</p>
<p align="left">However, the Catholic moral viewpoint is founded on human reason
illumined by faith and is consciously motivated by the desire to do the will of
God our Father. The Church is thus in a position to learn from scientific
discovery but also to transcend the horizons of science and to be confident that
her more global vision does greater justice to the rich reality of the human
person in his spiritual and physical dimensions, created by God and heir, by
grace, to eternal life.</p>
<p align="left">It is within this context, then, that it can be clearly seen
that the phenomenon of homosexuality, complex as it is, and with its many
consequences for society and ecclesial life, is a proper focus for the Church's
pastoral care. It thus requires of her ministers attentive study, active concern
and honest, theologically well-balanced counsel.</p>
<p align="left">3. Explicit treatment of the problem was given in this
Congregation's &quot;Declaration on Certain Questions Concerning Sexual
Ethics&quot; of December 29, 1975. That document stressed the duty of trying to
understand the homosexual condition and noted that culpability for homosexual
acts should only be judged with prudence. At the same time the Congregation took
note of the distinction commonly drawn between the homosexual condition or
tendency and individual homosexual actions. These were described as deprived of
their essential and indispensable finality, as being &quot;intrinsically
disordered&quot;, and able in no case to be approved of (cf. n. 8, $4).</p>
<p align="left">In the discussion which followed the publication of the
Declaration, however, an overly benign interpretation was given to the
homosexual condition itself, some going so far as to call it neutral, or even
good. Although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin,
it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; and
thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder.</p>
<p align="left">Therefore special concern and pastoral attention should be
directed toward those who have this condition, lest they be led to believe that
the living out of this orientation in homosexual activity is a morally
acceptable option. It is not.</p>
<p align="left">4. An essential dimension of authentic pastoral care is the
identification of causes of confusion regarding the Church's teaching. One is a
new exegesis of Sacred Scripture which claims variously that Scripture has
nothing to say on the subject of homosexuality, or that it somehow tacitly
approves of it, or that all of its moral injunctions are so culture-bound that
they are no longer applicable to contemporary life. These views are gravely
erroneous and call for particular attention here.</p>
<p align="left">5. It is quite true that the Biblical literature owes to the
different epochs in which it was written a good deal of its varied patterns of
thought and expression (Dei Verbum 12). The Church today addresses the Gospel to
a world which differs in many ways from ancient days. But the world in which the
New Testament was written was already quite diverse from the situation in which
the Sacred Scriptures of the Hebrew People had been written or compiled, for
example.</p>
<p align="left">What should be noticed is that, in the presence of such
remarkable diversity, there is nevertheless a clear consistency within the
Scriptures themselves on the moral issue of homosexual behaviour. The Church's
doctrine regarding this issue is thus based, not on isolated phrases for facile
theological argument, but on the solid foundation of a constant Biblical
testimony. The community of faith today, in unbroken continuity with the Jewish
and Christian communities within which the ancient Scriptures were written,
continues to be nourished by those same Scriptures and by the Spirit of Truth
whose Word they are. It is likewise essential to recognize that the Scriptures
are not properly understood when they are interpreted in a way which contradicts
the Church's living Tradition. To be correct, the interpretation of Scripture
must be in substantial accord with that Tradition.</p>
<p align="left">The Vatican Council II in Dei Verbum 10, put it this way:
&quot;It is clear, therefore, that in the supremely wise arrangement of God,
sacred Tradition, sacred Scripture, and the Magisterium of the Church are so
connected and associated that one of them cannot stand without the others.
Working together, each in its own way under the action of the one Holy Spirit,
they all contribute effectively to the salvation of souls&quot;. In that spirit
we wish to outline briefly the Biblical teaching here.</p>
<p align="left">6. Providing a basic plan for understanding this entire
discussion of homosexuality is the theology of creation we find in Genesis. God,
in his infinite wisdom and love, brings into existence all of reality as a
reflection of his goodness. He fashions mankind, male and female, in his own
image and likeness. Human beings, therefore, are nothing less than the work of
God himself; and in the complementarity of the sexes, they are called to reflect
the inner unity of the Creator. They do this in a striking way in their
cooperation with him in the transmission of life by a mutual donation of the
self to the other.</p>
<p align="left">In Genesis 3, we find that this truth about persons being an
image of God has been obscured by original sin. There inevitably follows a loss
of awareness of the covenantal character of the union these persons had with God
and with each other. The human body retains its &quot;spousal significance&quot;
but this is now clouded by sin. Thus, in Genesis 19:1-11, the deterioration due
to sin continues in the story of the men of Sodom. There can be no doubt of the
moral judgement made there against homosexual relations. In Leviticus 18:22 and
20:13, in the course of describing the conditions necessary for belonging to the
Chosen People, the author excludes from the People of God those who behave in a
homosexual fashion.</p>
<p align="left">Against the background of this exposition of theocratic law, an
eschatological perspective is developed by St. Paul when, in I Cor 6:9, he
proposes the same doctrine and lists those who behave in a homosexual fashion
among those who shall not enter the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p align="left">In Romans 1:18-32, still building on the moral traditions of his
forebears, but in the new context of the confrontation between Christianity and
the pagan society of his day, Paul uses homosexual behaviour as an example of
the blindness which has overcome humankind. Instead of the original harmony
between Creator and creatures, the acute distortion of idolatry has led to all
kinds of moral excess. Paul is at a loss to find a clearer example of this
disharmony than homosexual relations. Finally, 1 Tim. 1, in full continuity with
the Biblical position, singles out those who spread wrong doctrine and in v. 10
explicitly names as sinners those who engage in homosexual acts.</p>
<p align="left">7. The Church, obedient to the Lord who founded her and gave to
her the sacramental life, celebrates the divine plan of the loving and
live-giving union of men and women in the sacrament of marriage. It is only in
the marital relationship that the use of the sexual faculty can be morally good.
A person engaging in homosexual behaviour therefore acts immorally.</p>
<p align="left">To chose someone of the same sex for one's sexual activity is to
annul the rich symbolism and meaning, not to mention the goals, of the Creator's
sexual design. Homosexual activity is not a complementary union, able to
transmit life; and so it thwarts the call to a life of that form of self-giving
which the Gospel says is the essence of Christian living. This does not mean
that homosexual persons are not often generous and giving of themselves; but
when they engage in homosexual activity they confirm within themselves a
disordered sexual inclination which is essentially self-indulgent.</p>
<p align="left">As in every moral disorder, homosexual activity prevents one's
own fulfillment and happiness by acting contrary to the creative wisdom of God.
The Church, in rejecting erroneous opinions regarding homosexuality, does not
limit but rather defends personal freedom and dignity realistically and
authentically understood.</p>
<p align="left">8. Thus, the Church's teaching today is in organic continuity
with the Scriptural perspective and with her own constant Tradition. Though
today's world is in many ways quite new, the Christian community senses the
profound and lasting bonds which join us to those generations who have gone
before us, &quot;marked with the sign of faith&quot;.</p>
<p align="left">Nevertheless, increasing numbers of people today, even within
the Church, are bringing enormous pressure to bear on the Church to accept the
homosexual condition as though it were not disordered and to condone homosexual
activity. Those within the Church who argue in this fashion often have close
ties with those with similar views outside it. These latter groups are guided by
a vision opposed to the truth about the human person, which is fully disclosed
in the mystery of Christ. They reflect, even if not entirely consciously, a
materialistic ideology which denies the transcendent nature of the human person
as well as the supernatural vocation of every individual.</p>
<p align="left">The Church's ministers must ensure that homosexual persons in
their care will not be misled by this point of view, so profoundly opposed to
the teaching of the Church. But the risk is great and there are many who seek to
create confusion regarding the Church's position, and then to use that confusion
to their own advantage.</p>
<p align="left">9. The movement within the Church, which takes the form of
pressure groups of various names and sizes, attempts to give the impression that
it represents all homosexual persons who are Catholics. As a matter of fact, its
membership is by and large restricted to those who either ignore the teaching of
the Church or seek somehow to undermine it. It brings together under the aegis
of Catholicism homosexual persons who have no intention of abandoning their
homosexual behaviour. One tactic used is to protest that any and all criticism
of or reservations about homosexual people, their activity and lifestyle, are
simply diverse forms of unjust discrimination.</p>
<p align="left">There is an effort in some countries to manipulate the Church by
gaining the often well-intentioned support of her pastors with a view to
changing civil-statutes and laws. This is done in order to conform to these
pressure groups' concept that homosexuality is at least a completely harmless,
if not an entirely good, thing. Even when the practice of homosexuality may
seriously threaten the lives and well-being of a large number of people, its
advocates remain undeterred and refuse to consider the magnitude of the risks
involved.</p>
<p align="left">The Church can never be so callous. It is true that her clear
position cannot be revised by pressure from civil legislation or the trend of
the moment. But she is really concerned about the many who are not represented
by the pro-homosexual movement and about those who may have been tempted to
believe its deceitful propaganda. She is also aware that the view that
homosexual activity is equivalent to, or as acceptable as, the sexual expression
of conjugal love has a direct impact on society's understanding of the nature
and rights of the family and puts them in jeopardy.</p>
<p align="left">10. It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are
the object of violent malice in speech or in action. Such treatment deserves
condemnation from the Church's pastors wherever it occurs. It reveals a kind of
disregard for others which endangers the most fundamental principles of a
healthy society. The intrinsic dignity of each person must always be respected
in word, in action and in law.</p>
<p align="left">But the proper reaction to crimes committed against homosexual
persons should not be to claim that the homosexual condition is not disordered.
When such a claim is made and when homosexual activity is consequently condoned,
or when civil legislation is introduced to protect behavior to which no one has
any conceivable right, neither the Church nor society at large should be
surprised when other distorted notions and practices gain ground, and irrational
and violent reactions increase.</p>
<p align="left">11. It has been argued that the homosexual orientation in
certain cases is not the result of deliberate choice; and so the homosexual
person would then have no choice but to behave in a homosexual fashion. Lacking
freedom, such a person, even if engaged in homosexual activity, would not be
culpable.</p>
<p align="left">Here, the Church's wise moral tradition is necessary since it
warns against generalizations in judging individual cases. In fact,
circumstances may exist, or may have existed in the past, which would reduce or
remove the culpability of the individual in a given instance; or other
circumstances may increase it. What is at all costs to be avoided is the
unfounded and demeaning assumption that the sexual behaviour of homosexual
persons is always and totally compulsive and therefore inculpable. What is
essential is that the fundamental liberty which characterizes the human person
and gives him his dignity be recognized as belonging to the homosexual person as
well. As in every conversion from evil, the abandonment of homosexual activity
will require a profound collaboration of the individual with God's liberating
grace.</p>
<p align="left">12. What, then, are homosexual persons to do who seek to follow
the Lord? Fundamentally, they are called to enact the will of God in their life
by joining whatever sufferings and difficulties they experience in virtue of
their condition to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross. That Cross, for the
believer, is a fruitful sacrifice since from that death come life and
redemption. While any call to carry the cross or to understand a Christian's
suffering in this way will predictably be met with bitter ridicule by some, it
should be remembered that this is the way to eternal life for all who follow
Christ.</p>
<p align="left">It is, in effect, none other than the teaching of Paul the
Apostle to the Galatians when he says that the Spirit produces in the lives of
the faithful &quot;love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, trustfulness,
gentleness and self-control&quot; (5:22) and further (v. 24), &quot;You cannot
belong to Christ unless you crucify all self-indulgent passions and
desires.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">It is easily misunderstood, however, if it is merely seen as a
pointless effort at self-denial. The Cross is a denial of self, but in service
to the will of God himself who makes life come from death and empowers those who
trust in him to practise virtue in place of vice.</p>
<p align="left">To celebrate the Paschal Mystery, it is necessary to let that
Mystery become imprinted in the fabric of daily life. To refuse to sacrifice
one's own will in obedience to the will of the Lord is effectively to prevent
salvation. Just as the Cross was central to the expression of God's redemptive
love for us in Jesus, so the conformity of the self-denial of homosexual men and
women with the sacrifice of the Lord will constitute for them a source of
self-giving which will save them from a way of life which constantly threatens
to destroy them.</p>
<p align="left">Christians who are homosexual are called, as all of us are, to a
chaste life. As they dedicate their lives to understanding the nature of God's
personal call to them, they will be able to celebrate the Sacrament of Penance
more faithfully and receive the Lord's grace so freely offered there in order to
convert their lives more fully to his Way.</p>
<p align="left">13. We recognize, of course, that in great measure the clear and
successful communication of the Church's teaching to all the faithful, and to
society at large, depends on the correct instruction and fidelity of her
pastoral ministers. The Bishops have the particularly grave responsibility to
see to it that their assistants in the ministry, above all the priests, are
rightly informed and personally disposed to bring the teaching of the Church in
its integrity to everyone.</p>
<p align="left">The characteristic concern and good will exhibited by many
clergy and religious in their pastoral care for homosexual persons is admirable,
and, we hope, will not diminish. Such devoted ministers should have the
confidence that they are faithfully following the will of the Lord by
encouraging the homosexual person to lead a chaste life and by affirming that
person's God-given dignity and worth.</p>
<p align="left">14. With this in mind, this Congregation wishes to ask the
Bishops to be especially cautious of any programmes which may seek to pressure
the Church to change her teaching, even while claiming not to do so. A careful
examination of their public statements and the activities they promote reveals a
studied ambiguity by which they attempt to mislead the pastors and the faithful.
For example, they may present the teaching of the Magisterium, but only as if it
were an optional source for the formation of one's conscience. Its specific
authority is not recognized. Some of these groups will use the word
&quot;Catholic&quot; to describe either the organization or its intended
members, yet they do not defend and promote the teaching of the Magisterium;
indeed, they even openly attack it. While their members may claim a desire to
conform their lives to the teaching of Jesus, in fact they abandon the teaching
of his Church. This contradictory action should not have the support of the
Bishops in any way.</p>
<p align="left">15. We encourage the Bishops, then, to provide pastoral care in
full accord with the teaching of the Church for homosexual persons of their
dioceses. No authentic pastoral programme will include organizations in which
homosexual persons associate with each other without clearly stating that
homosexual activity is immoral. A truly pastoral approach will appreciate the
need for homosexual persons to avoid the near occasions of sin.</p>
<p align="left">We would heartily encourage programmes where these dangers are
avoided. But we wish to make it clear that departure from the Church's teaching,
or silence about it, in an effort to provide pastoral care is neither caring nor
pastoral. Only what is true can ultimately be pastoral. The neglect of the
Church's position prevents homosexual men and women from receiving the care they
need and deserve.</p>
<p align="left">An authentic pastoral programme will assist homosexual persons
at all levels of the spiritual life: through the sacraments, and in particular
through the frequent and sincere use of the sacrament of Reconciliation, through
prayer, witness, counsel and individual care. In such a way, the entire
Christian community can come to recognize its own call to assist its brothers
and sisters, without deluding them or isolating them.</p>
<p align="left">16. From this multi-faceted approach there are numerous
advantages to be gained, not the least of which is the realization that a
homosexual person, as every human being, deeply needs to be nourished at many
different levels simultaneously.</p>
<p align="left">The human person, made in the image and likeness of God, can
hardly be adequately described by a reductionist reference to his or her sexual
orientation. Every one living on the face of the earth has personal problems and
difficulties, but challenges to growth, strengths, talents and gifts as well.
Today, the Church provides a badly needed context for the care of the human
person when she refuses to consider the person as a &quot;heterosexual&quot; or
a &quot;homosexual&quot; and insists that every person has a fundamental
Identity: the creature of God, and by grace, his child and heir to eternal life.</p>
<p align="left">17. In bringing this entire matter to the Bishops' attention,
this Congregation wishes to support their efforts to assure that the teaching of
the Lord and his Church on this important question be communicated fully to all
the faithful.</p>
<p align="left">In light of the points made above, they should decide for their
own dioceses the extent to which an intervention on their part is indicated. In
addition, should they consider it helpful, further coordinated action at the
level of their National Bishops' Conference may be envisioned.</p>
<p align="left">In a particular way, we would ask the Bishops to support, with
the means at their disposal, the development of appropriate forms of pastoral
care for homosexual persons. These would include the assistance of the
psychological, sociological and medical sciences, in full accord with the
teaching of the Church.</p>
<p align="left">They are encouraged to call on the assistance of all Catholic
theologians who, by teaching what the Church teaches, and by deepening their
reflections on the true meaning of human sexuality and Christian marriage with
the virtues it engenders, will make an important contribution in this particular
area of pastoral care.</p>
<p align="left">The Bishops are asked to exercise special care in the selection
of pastoral ministers so that by their own high degree of spiritual and personal
maturity and by their fidelity to the Magisterium, they may be of real service
to homosexual persons, promoting their health and well-being in the fullest
sense. Such ministers will reject theological opinions which dissent from the
teaching of the Church and which, therefore, cannot be used as guidelines for
pastoral care.</p>
<p align="left">We encourage the Bishops to promote appropriate catechetical
programmes based on the truth about human sexuality in its relationship to the
family as taught by the Church. Such programmes should provide a good context
within which to deal with the question of homosexuality.</p>
<p align="left">This catechesis would also assist those families of homosexual
persons to deal with this problem which affects them so deeply.</p>
<p align="left">All support should be withdrawn from any organizations which
seek to undermine the teaching of the Church, which are ambiguous about it, or
which neglect it entirely. Such support, or even the semblance of such support,
can be gravely misinterpreted. Special attention should be given to the practice
of scheduling religious services and to the use of Church buildings by these
groups, including the facilities of Catholic schools and colleges. To some, such
permission to use Church property may seem only just and charitable; but in
reality it is contradictory to the purpose for which these institutions were
founded, it is misleading and often scandalous.</p>
<p align="left">In assessing proposed legislation, the Bishops should keep as
their uppermost concern the responsibility to defend and promote family life.</p>
<p align="left">18. The Lord Jesus promised, &quot;You shall know the truth and
the truth shall set you free&quot; (<i>Jn</i>. 8:32). Scripture bids us speak
the truth in love (cf. <i>Eph</i>. 4:15). The God who is at once truth and love
calls the Church to minister to every man, woman and child with the pastoral
solicitude of our compassionate Lord. It is in this spirit that we have
addressed this Letter to the Bishops of the Church, with the hope that it will
be of some help as they care for those whose suffering can only be intensified
by error and lightened by truth.</p>
