<P><B>INTRODUCTION</B></P></CENTER>
<P>1. THE LAY MEMBERS of Christ's Faithful People <I>(Christifideles Laici), 
</I>whose &quot;Vocation and Mission in the Church and in the World Twenty Years 
after the Second Vatican Council&quot; was the topic of the 1987 Synod of Bishops, 
are those who form that part of the People of God which might be likened to the 
labourers in the vineyard mentioned in Matthew's Gospel: &quot;For the Kingdom of 
heaven is like a householder who went out early in the morning to hire labourers 
for his vineyard. After agreeing with the labourers for a denarius a day, he 
sent them into his vineyard&quot; (<I>Mt </I>20:1-2).</P>
<P>The gospel parable sets before our eyes the Lord's vast vineyard and the 
multitude of persons, both women and men, who are called and sent forth by him 
to labour in it. The vineyard is the whole world (cf. <I>Mt</I> 13:38), which is 
to be transformed according to the plan of God in view of the final coming of 
the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P><I><B>You Go Into My Vineyard Too</B></I></P>
<P>2. &quot;And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the 
marketplace; and to them he said, 'You go into the vineyard too'&quot; (<I>Mt</I>
 20:3-4).</P>
<P>From that distant day the call of the Lord Jesus &quot;You go into my vineyard 
too&quot; never fails to resound in the course of history: it is addressed to every 
person who comes into this world.</P>
<P>In our times, the Church after Vatican II in a renewed outpouring of the 
Spirit of Pentecost has come to a more lively awareness of her missionary nature 
and has listened again to the voice of her Lord who sends her forth into the 
world as &quot;the universal sacrament of salvation&quot;(1).</P>
<P><I>You go too</I>. The call is a concern not only of Pastors, clergy, and men 
and women religious. The call is addressed to everyone: lay people as well are 
personally called by the Lord, from whom they receive a mission on behalf of the 
Church and the world. In preaching to the people Saint Gregory the Great recalls 
this fact and comments on the parable of the labourers in the vineyard: &quot;Keep 
watch over your manner of life, dear people, and make sure that you are indeed 
the Lord's labourers. Each person should take into account what he does and 
consider if he is labouring in the vineyard of the Lord&quot;(2).</P>
<P>The Council, in particular, with its rich doctrinal, spiritual and pastoral 
patrimony, has written as never before on the nature, dignity, spirituality, 
mission and responsibility of the lay faithful. And the <I>Council Fathers, 
re-echoing the call of Christ, have summoned all the lay faithful, both women 
and men, to labour in the vineyard: </I>&quot;The Council, then, makes an earnest 
plea in the Lord's name that all lay people give a glad, generous, and prompt 
response to the impulse of the Holy Spirit and to the voice of Christ, who is 
giving them an especially urgent invitation at this moment. Young people should 
feel that this call is directed to them in particular, and they should respond 
to it eagerly and magnanimously. The Lord himself renews his invitation to all 
the lay faithful to come closer to him every day, and with the recognition that 
what is his is also their own (<I>Phil </I>2:5) they ought to associate 
themselves with him in his saving mission. Once again he sends them into every 
town and place where he himself is to come (cf. <I>Lk 
</I>10:1)&quot;(3).</P>
<P><I>You go into my vineyard too. </I>During the <I>Synod </I><I>of </I><I>
Bishops,

</I>held in Rome, 1-30 October 1987, these words were re-echoed in spirit once 
again. Following the path marked out by the Council and remaining open to the 
light of the experience of persons and communities from the whole Church, the 
Fathers, enriched by preceding Synods, treated in a specific and extensive 
manner the topic of the vocation and mission of the lay faithful in the Church 
and in the world.</P>
<P>In this assembly of bishops there was not lacking a qualified representation 
of the lay faithful, both women and men, which rendered a valuable contribution 
to the Synod proceedings. This was publicly acknowledged in the concluding 
homily: &quot;We give thanks that during the course of the Synod we have not only 
rejoiced in the participation of the lay faithful (both men and women auditors), 
but even more so in that the progress of the Synodal discussions has enabled us 
to listen to those whom we invited, representatives of the lay faithful from all 
parts of the world, from different countries, and to profit from their 
experience, their advice and the suggestions they have offered out of love for 
the common cause&quot;(4).</P>
<P>In looking over the years following the Council the Synod Fathers have been 
able to verify how the Holy Spirit continues to renew the youth of the Church 
and how he has inspired new aspirations towards holiness and the participation 
of so many lay faithful. This is witnessed, among other ways, in the new manner 
of active collaboration among priests, religious and the lay faithful; the 
active participation in the Liturgy, in the proclamation of the Word of God and 
catechesis; the multiplicity of services and tasks entrusted to the lay faithful 
and fulfilled by them; the flourishing of groups, associations and spiritual 
movements as well as a lay commitment in the life of the Church; and in the 
fuller and meaningful participation of women in the development of society.</P>
<P>At the same time, the Synod has pointed out that the post-conciliar path of 
the lay faithful has not been without its difficulties and dangers. In 
particular, two temptations can be cited which they have not always known how to 
avoid: the temptation of being so strongly interested in Church services and 
tasks that some fail to become actively engaged in their responsibilities in the 
professional, social, cultural and political world; and the temptation of 
legitimizing the unwarranted separation of faith from life, that is, a 
separation of the Gospel's acceptance from the actual living of the Gospel in 
various situations in the world.</P>
<P>In the course of its work, the Synod made constant reference to the Second 
Vatican Council, whose teaching on the lay faithful, after twenty years, has 
taken on a surprisingly contemporary character and at times has carried 
prophetic significance: such teaching has the capacity of enlightening and 
guiding the responses that today must be given to new situations. In reality, 
the challenge embraced by the Synod Fathers has been that of indicating the 
concrete ways through which this rich &quot;theory&quot; on the lay state expressed by the 
Council can be translated into authentic Church &quot;practice&quot;. Some situations have 
made themselves felt because of a certain &quot;novelty&quot; that they have, and in this 
sense they can be called post-conciliar, at least chronologically: to these the 
Synod Fathers have rightly given a particular attention in the course of their 
discussion and reflection. Among those situations to be recalled are those 
regarding the ministries and Church services entrusted at present and in the 
future to the lay faithful, the growth and spread of new &quot;movements&quot; alongside 
other group forms of lay involvement, and the place and role of women both in 
the Church and in society.</P>
<P>At the conclusion of their work, which proceeded with great commitment, 
competence and generosity, the Synod Fathers made known to me their desires and 
requested that at an opportune time, a conclusive papal document on the topic of 
the lay faithful be offered to the Universal Church(5).</P>
<P>This Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation intends to take into account all the 
richness of the Synod work, from the <I>Lineamenta </I>to the <I>Instrumentum 
Laboris, </I>from the introductory report, the presentations of individual 
bishops and lay persons to the summary reports after discussion in the Synod 
hall, from the discussions and reports of the &quot;small groups&quot; to the final 
&quot;Propositions&quot; and the concluding &quot;Message&quot;. For this reason the present 
document is not something in contradistinction to the Synod, but is meant to be 
a faithful and coherent expression of it, a fruit of collegiality. As such, the 
Council of the General Secretariat of the Synod of Bishops and the Secretariat 
itself have contributed to its final form.</P>
<P>This Exhortation intends to stir and promote a deeper awareness among all the 
faithful of the gift and responsibility they share, both as a group and as 
individuals, in the communion and mission of the Church.</P>
<P><I><B>The Pressing Needs of the World Today: &quot;Why do you stand here idle all 
day?&quot;</B></I></P>
<P>3. The basic meaning of this Synod and the most precious fruit desired as a 
result of it, is the <I>lay faithful's hearkening to the call of Christ the Lord 
to work in his vineyard, </I>to take an active, conscientious and responsible 
part in the mission of the Church <I>in this great moment in history, </I>made 
especially dramatic by occurring on the threshold of the Third Millennium.</P>
<P>A new state of affairs today both in the Church and in social, economic, 
political and cultural life, calls with a particular urgency for the action of 
the lay faithful. If lack of commitment is always unacceptable, the present time 
renders it even more so. <I>It is not permissible for anyone to remain idle.</I></P>
<P>We continue in our reading of the gospel parable: &quot;And about the eleventh 
hour he went out and found others standing; and he said to them, 'Why do you 
stand here idle all day?'. They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us'. He 
said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too'&quot;( <I>Mt </I>20:6-7).</P>
<P>Since the work that awaits everyone in the vineyard of the Lord is so great 
there is no place for idleness. With even greater urgency the &quot;householder&quot; 
repeats his invitation: &quot;You go into my vineyard too&quot;.</P>
<P>The voice of the Lord clearly resounds in the depths of each of Christ's 
followers, who through faith and the sacraments of Christian initiation is made 
like to Jesus Christ, is incorporated as a living member in the Church and has 
an active part in her mission of salvation. The voice of the Lord also comes to 
be heard through the historic events of the Church and humanity, as the Council 
reminds us: &quot;The People of God believes that it is led by the Spirit of the 
Lord, who fills the whole world. Moved by this faith it tries to discern 
authentic signs of God's presence and purpose in the events, the needs, and the 
longings which it shares with other people of our time. For faith throws a new 
light on all things and makes known the full ideal to which God has called each 
individual, and thus guides the mind towards solutions which are fully 
human&quot;(6).</P>
<P>It is necessary, then, to keep a watchful eye on this our world, with its 
problems and values, its unrest and hopes, its defeats and triumphs: a world 
whose economic, social, political and cultural affairs pose problems and grave 
difficulties in light of the description provided by the Council in the Pastoral 
Constitution, <I>Gaudium et Spes.</I>(7)<I>This, </I>then, is the vineyard; 
<I>this </I>is the field in which the faithful are called to fulfill their 
mission. Jesus wants them, as he wants all his disciples, to be the &quot;salt of the 
earth&quot; and the &quot;light of the world&quot; (cf. <I>Mt</I> 
5:13-14). But what is the <I>actual state of affairs </I>of the &quot;earth&quot; and the 
&quot;world&quot;, for which Christians ought to be &quot;salt&quot; and &quot;light&quot;?</P>
<P>The variety of situations and problems that exist in our world is indeed 
great and rapidly changing. For this reason it is all the more necessary to 
guard against generalizations and unwarranted simplifications. It is possible, 
however, to highlight <I>some trends that are emerging in present-day society. 
</I>The gospel records that the weeds and the good grain grew together in the 
farmer's field. The same is true in history, where in everyday life there often 
exist contradictions in the exercise of human freedom, where there is found, 
side by side and at times closely intertwined, evil and good, injustice and 
justice, anguish and hope.</P>
<P><B><I>Secularism and the Need for Religion</I></B></P>
<P>4. How can one not notice the ever-growing existence of <I>religious 
indifference </I>and <I>atheism </I>in its more varied forms, particularly in 
its perhaps most widespread form of <I>secularism? </I>Adversely affected by the 
impressive triumphs of continuing scientific and technological development and 
above all, fascinated by a very old and yet new temptation, namely, that of 
wishing to become like God (cf. <I>Gen </I>3:5)<I> </I>through the use of a 
liberty without bounds, individuals cut the religious roots that are in their 
hearts; they forget God, or simply retain him without meaning in their lives, or 
outrightly reject him, and begin to adore various &quot;idols&quot; of the contemporary 
world.</P>
<P>The present-day phenomenon of secularism is truly serious, not simply as 
regards the individual, but in some ways, as regards whole communities, as the 
Council has already indicated: &quot;Growing numbers of people are abandoning 
religion in practice&quot;(8). At other times I myself have recalled the phenomenon 
of de-Christianization that strikes long-standing Christian people and which 
continually calls for a re-evangelization.</P>
<P><I>Human longing and the need tor religion, </I>however, are not able to be 
totally extinguished. When persons in conscience have the courage to face the 
more serious questions of human existence-particularly questions related to the 
purpose of life, to suffering and to dying-they are unable to avoid making their 
own the words of truth uttered by Saint Augustine: &quot;You have made us for 
yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you&quot;(9).In the 
same manner the present-day world bears witness to this as well, in 
ever-increasing and impressive ways, through an openness to a spiritual and 
transcendent outlook towards life, the renewed interest in religious research, 
the return to a sense of the sacred and to prayer, and the demand for freedom to 
call upon the name of the Lord.</P>
<P><B><I>The Human Person: A Dignity Violated and Exalted</I></B></P>
<P>5. We furthermore call to mind the <I>violations </I>to which the human 
person is subjected. When the individual is not recognized and loved in the 
person's dignity as the living image of God (cf. <I>Gen </I>1:26), the human 
being is exposed to more humiliating and degrading forms of &quot;manipulation&quot;, that 
most assuredly reduce the individual to a slavery to those who are stronger. 
&quot;Those who are stronger&quot; can take a variety of names: an ideology; economic 
power, political and inhumane systems, scientific technocracy or the 
intrusiveness of the mass-media. Once again we find ourselves before many 
persons, our sisters and brothers, whose fundamental rights are being violated, 
owing to their exceedingly great capacity for endurance and to the clear 
injustice of certain civil laws: the right to life and to integrity, the right 
to a house and to work, the right to a family and responsible parenthood, the 
right to participation in public and political life, the right to freedom of 
conscience and the practice of religion.</P>
<P>Who is able to count the number of babies unborn because they have been 
killed in their mothers' wombs, children abandoned and abused by their own 
parents, children who grow without affection and education? In some countries 
entire populations are deprived of housing and work, lacking the means 
absolutely essential for leading a life worthy of a human being, and are 
deprived even of those things necessary for their sustenance. There are great 
areas of poverty and of misery, both physical and moral, existing at this moment 
on the periphery of great cities. Entire groups of human beings have been 
seriously afflicted.</P>
<P>But the <I>sacredness of the human person </I>cannot be obliterated, no 
matter how often it is devalued and violated because it has its unshakable 
foundation in God as Creator and Father. The sacredness of the person always 
keeps returning, again and again.</P>
<P>The sense of the dignity of the human person must be pondered and reaffirmed 
in stronger. terms. A beneficial trend is advancing and permeating all peoples 
of the earth, making them ever more aware of the dignity of the individual: the 
person is not at all a &quot;thing&quot; or an &quot;object&quot; to be used, but primarily a 
responsible &quot;subject&quot;, one endowed with conscience and freedom, called to live 
responsibly in society and history, and oriented towards spiritual and religious 
values.</P>
<P>It has been said that ours is the time of &quot;humanism&quot;: paradoxically, some of 
its atheistic and secularistic forms arrive at a point where the human person is 
diminished and annihilated; other forms of humanism, instead, exalt the 
individual in such a manner that these forms become a veritable and real 
idolatry. There are still other forms, however, in line with the truth, which 
rightly acknowledge the greatness and misery of individuals and manifest, 
sustain and foster the total dignity of the human person.</P>
<P>The sign and fruit of this trend towards humanism is the growing need for 
<I>participation, </I>which is undoubtedly one of the distinctive features of 
present-day humanity, a true &quot;sign of the times&quot; that is developing in various 
fields and in different ways: above all the growing need for participation 
regarding women and young people, not only in areas of family and academic life, 
but also in cultural, economic, social and political areas. To be leading 
characters in this development, in some ways to be creators of a new, more 
humane culture, is a requirement both for the individual and for peoples as a 
whole(10).</P>
<P><B><I>Conflict and Peace</I></B></P>
<P>6. Finally, we are unable to overlook another phenomenon that is quite 
evident in present-day humanity: perhaps as never before in history, humanity is 
daily buffeted by <I>conflict. </I>This is a phenomenon which has many forms, 
displayed in a legitimate plurality of mentalities and initiatives, but 
manifested in the fatal opposition of persons, groups, categories, nations and 
blocks of nations. This opposition takes the form of violence, of terrorism, and 
of war. Once again, but with proportions enormously widespread, diverse sectors 
of humanity today, wishing to show their &quot;omnipotence&quot;, renew the futile 
experience of constructing the &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; (cf. <I>Gen 
</I>11:1-9), which spreads confusion, struggle, disintegration and oppression. 
The human family is thus in itself dramatically convulsed and wounded.</P>
<P>On the other hand, totally unsupressible is that human longing experienced by 
individuals and whole peoples for the inestimable good of <I>peace </I>in 
justice. The gospel beatitude: &quot;Blessed are the peacemakers&quot; <I>(Mt 
</I>5:9)<I> </I>finds in the people of our time a new and significant resonance: 
entire populations today live, suffer and labour to bring about peace and 
justice. The <I>participation </I>by so many persons and groups in the life of 
society is increasingly pursued today as the way to make a desired peace become 
a reality.</P>
<P>On this road we meet many lay faithful generously committed to the social and 
political field, working in a variety of institutional forms and those of a 
voluntary nature in service to the least.</P>
<P><B><I>Jesus Christ, the Hope of Humanity </I></B></P>
<P>7. This, then, is the vast field of labour that stands before the labourers 
sent forth by the &quot;householder&quot; to work in his vineyard.</P>
<P>In this field the Church is present and working, every one of us, Pastors, 
priests, deacons, religious and lay faithful. The adverse situations here 
mentioned deeply affect the Church: they in part condition the Church, but they 
do not crush her, nor even less overcome her, because the Holy Spirit, who gives 
her life, sustains her in her mission.</P>
<P>Despite every difficulty, delay and contradiction caused by the limits of 
human nature, by sin and by the Evil One, the Church knows that all the forces 
that humanity employs for communion and participation find a full response in 
the intervention of Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of man and of the world.</P>
<P>The Church knows that she is sent forth by him as &quot;sign and instrument of 
intimate union with God and of the unity of all the human race&quot;(11).</P>
<P>Despite all this, then, humanity is able to hope. Indeed it must hope: the 
living and personal Gospel, <I>Jesus Christ himself, is the &quot;good news&quot; and the 
bearer of joy </I>that the Church announces each day, and to whom the Church 
bears testimony before all people.</P>
<P>The lay faithful have an essential and irreplaceable role in this 
announcement and in this testimony: through them the Church of Christ is made 
present in the various sectors of the world, as a sign and source of hope and of 
love.</P>

<P><B>CHAPTER I</B></P> 
<P><B>I AM THE VINE AND YOU ARE THE BRANCHES<BR>The Dignity of the Lay Faithful 
in the Church as Mystery</B></P></CENTER>
<P><B><I>The Mystery of the Vine </I></B></P>
<P>8. The Sacred Scriptures use the image of the vine in various ways. In a 
particular case, the vine serves to express the <I>Mystery of the People of God. </I>
From this perspective which emphasizes the Church's internal nature, the lay 
faithful are seen not simply as labourers who work in the vineyard, but as 
themselves being a part of the vineyard. Jesus says, &quot;I am the vine, you are the 
branches&quot; (<I>Jn </I>15:5).</P>
<P>The prophets in the Old Testament used the image of the vine to describe the 
chosen people. Israel is God's vine, the Lord's own work, the joy of his heart: 
&quot;I have planted you a choice vine&quot; (<I>Jer </I>2:21); &quot;Your mother was like a 
vine in a vineyard transplanted by the water, fruitful and full of branches by 
reason of abundant water&quot; (<I>Ez</I><I> </I>19:10); &quot;My beloved had a vineyard 
on a very fertile hill. He dug it and cleared it of stones and planted it with 
choice vines ...&quot;(<I>(Is </I>5:1-2).</P>
<P>Jesus himself once again takes up the symbol of the vine and uses it to 
illustrate various aspects of the Kingdom of God: &quot;A man planted a vineyard, and 
set a hedge around it, and dug a pit for the winepress, and built a tower and 
let it out to tenants and went into another country&quot; (<I>Mk 
</I>12:1; cf. <I>Mt </I>21:28 ff.).</P>
<P>John the Evangelist invites us to go further and leads us to discover <I>the 
mystery of the vine: </I>it is the figure and symbol not only of the People of 
God, but of <I>Jesus himself. </I>He is the vine and we, his disciples, are the 
branches. He is the &quot;true vine&quot;, to which the branches are engrafted to have 
life (cf. <I>Jn </I>15:1 ff.).</P>
<P>The Second Vatican Council, making reference to the various biblical images 
that help to reveal the mystery of the Church, proposes again the image of the 
vine and the branches: &quot;Christ is the true vine who gives life and fruitfulness 
to the branches, that is, to us. Through the Church we abide in Christ, without 
whom we can do nothing (<I>Jn </I>15:1-5)&quot;(12). The Church herself, then, is the 
vine in the gospel. She is <I>mystery </I>because the very life and love of the 
Father, Son and Holy Spirit are the gift gratuitously offered to all those who 
are born of water and the Holy Spirit (cf. <I>Jn </I>3:5), and called to relive 
the very <I>communion </I>of God and to manifest it and communicate it in 
history (mission): &quot;In that day&quot;, Jesus says, &quot;you will know tkat I am in my 
Father and you in me, and I in you&quot; (<I>Jn </I>14:20).</P>
<P>Only <I>from inside the Church's mystery of communion is the &quot;identity&quot; of 
the lay faithful made known, </I>and their fundamental dignity revealed. Only 
within the context of this dignity can their vocation and mission in the Church 
and in the world be defined.</P>
<P><B><I>Who are the Lay Faithful </I></B></P>
<P>9. The Synod Fathers have rightly pointed to the need for a definition of the 
lay faithful's vocation and mission in <I>positive terms, </I>through an 
in-depth study of the teachings of the Second Vatican Council in light of both 
recent documentation from the Magisterium and the lived experience of the 
Church, guided as she is by the Holy Spirit(13).</P>
<P>In giving a response to the question &quot;Who are the lay faithful&quot;, the Council 
went beyond previous interpretations which were predominantly negative. Instead 
it opened itself to a decidedly positive vision and displayed a basic intention 
of asserting <I>the full belonging of the lay faithful to the Church and to its 
mystery.</I></P>
<P><I>At the same time it insisted on the unique character </I><I>of </I><I>
their vocation, </I>which is in a special way to &quot;seek the Kingdom of God by 
engaging in temporal affairs and ordering them according to the plan of 
God&quot;(14). &quot;The term 'lay faithful'&quot; -we read in the Constitution on the Church,

<I>Lu</I><I>men Gentium-</I>&quot; is here understood to mean all the faithful except 
those in Holy Orders and those who belong to a religious state sanctioned by the 
Church. Through Baptism the lay faithful are made one body with Christ and are 
established among the People of God. They are in their own way made sharers in 
the priestly, prophetic and kingly office of Christ. They carry out their own 
part in the mission of the whole Christian people with respect to the Church and 
the world&quot;(15).</P>
<P>Pius XII once stated: &quot;The Faithful, more precisely the lay faithful, find 
themselves on the front lines of the Church's life; for them the Church is the 
animating principle for human society. Therefore, they in particular, ought to 
have an ever-clearer consciousness <I>not only </I><I>of </I><I>belonging to the 
Church, but </I><I>of </I><I>being the Church, </I>that is to say, the community 
of the faithful on earth under the leadership of the Pope, the head of all, and 
of the Bishops in communion with him. These <I>are the Church ...&quot;</I>(16).</P>
<P>According to the Biblical image of the vineyard, the lay faithful, together 
with all the other members of the Church, are branches engrafted to Christ the 
true vine, and from him derive their life and fruitfulness.</P>
<P>Incorporation into Christ through faith and Baptism is the source of being a 
Christian in the mystery of the Church. This mystery constitutes the Christian's 
most basic &quot;features&quot; and serves as the basis for all the vocations and dynamism 
of the Christian life of the lay faithful (cf. Jn 3:5). In Christ who died and 
rose from the dead, the baptized become a &quot;new creation&quot; (<I>Gal </I>6:15; 2 <I>
Cor </I>5:17), washed clean from sin and brought to life through grace.</P>
<P>Therefore, only through accepting the richness in mystery that God gives to 
the Christian in Baptism is it possible to come to a basic description of the 
lay faithful.</P>
<P><B><I>Baptism and the &quot;Newness&quot; of Christian Life </I></B></P>
<P>10. It is no exaggeration to say that the entire existence of the lay 
faithful has as its purpose to lead a person to a knowledge of the radical 
newness of the Christian life that comes from Baptism, the sacrament of faith, 
so that this knowledge can help that person live the responsibilities which 
arise from that vocation received from God. In arriving at a basic description 
of the lay faithful we now more explicitly and directly consider among others 
the following three fundamental aspects: <I>Baptism regenerates us in the life 
ot the Son of God; unites us to Christ and to his Body, the Church; and anoints 
us in the Holy Spirit, making us spiritual temples.</I></P>
<P><B><I>Children in the Son</I></B></P>
<P>11. We here recall Jesus' words to Nicodemus: &quot;Truly, truly, I say to you, 
unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God&quot;(<I>Jn </I>
3:5).<I> </I>Baptism, then, is a rebirth, a regeneration.</P>
<P>In considering this aspect of the gift which comes from Baptism, the apostle 
Peter breaks out into song: &quot;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus 
Christ! By his great mercy we have been born anew to a living hope through the 
resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and to an inheritance which is 
imperishable, undefiled and unfading&quot;( <I>1 Pt </I>1:3-4).<I> </I>And he calls 
Christians those who have been &quot;born anew, not of perishable seed but of 
imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God&quot; (<I>1 </I><I>Pt

</I>1:23).</P>
<P>With Baptism we become <I>children of God in his only-begotten Son, Jesus 
Christ. </I>Rising from the waters of the Baptismal font, every Christian hears 
again the voice that was once heard on the banks of the Jordan River: &quot;You are 
my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased&quot; <I>(Lk </I>3:22). From this comes 
the understanding that one has been brought into association with the beloved 
Son, becoming a child of adoption (cf. Gal 4:4-7) and a brother or sister of 
Christ. In this way the eternal plan of the Father for each person is realized 
in history: &quot;For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to 
the image of his Son, in order that he might be the first-born among many 
brethren&quot; <I>(Rom </I>8:29).</P>
<P>It is the <I>Holy Spirit </I>who constitutes the baptized as Children of God 
and members of Christ's Body. St. Paul reminds the Christians of Corinth of this 
fact: &quot;For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body&quot; (1 
<I>Cor </I>12:13), so that the apostle can say to the lay faithful: &quot;Now you are 
the body of Christ and individually members of it&quot; (<I>1</I> <I>Cor

</I>12:27); &quot;And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into 
our hearts&quot; (<I>Gal</I> 4:6; cf. <I>Rom </I>8:15-16).</P>
<P><B><I>We Are One Body in Christ</I></B></P>
<P>12 . Regenerated as &quot;Children in the Son&quot;, the baptized are inseparably 
joined together as <I>&quot;members of Christ and members of the body of the Church&quot;, </I>
as the Council of Florence teaches(17).</P>
<P>Baptism symbolizes and brings about a mystical but real incorporation into 
the crucified and glorious body of Christ. Through the sacrament Jesus unites 
the baptized to his death so as to unite the recipient to his resurrection (cf.

<I>Rom </I>6:3-5). The &quot;old man&quot; is stripped away for a reclothing with &quot;the new 
man&quot;, that is, with Jesus himself: &quot;For as many of you as were baptized into 
Christ have put on Christ&quot; <I>(Gal </I>3:27; cf.

<I>Eph </I>4:22-24; <I>Col </I>3:9-10). The result is that &quot;we, though many, are 
one body in Christ&quot; <I>(Rom </I>12:5).</P>
<P>In the words of Saint Paul we find again the faithful echo of the teaching of 
Jesus himself, which reveals <I>the mystical unity of Christ with his disciples 
and the disciples with each other, </I>presenting it as an image and extension 
of that mystical <I>communion </I>that binds the Father to the Son and the Son 
to the Father in the bond of love, the Holy Spirit (cf. <I>Jn </I>17:21). Jesus 
refers to this same unity in the image of the vine and the branches: &quot;I am the 
vine, you the branches&quot; <I>(Jn </I>15:5), an image that sheds light not only on 
the deep intimacy of the disciples with Jesus but on the necessity of a vital 
communion of the disciples with each other: all are branches of a single vine.</P>
<P><B><I><a name="Holy and Living Temples of the Spirit">Holy and Living Temples 
of the Spirit</a></I></B></P>
<P>13. In another comparison, using the image of a building, the apostle Peter 
defines the baptized as &quot;living stones&quot; founded on Christ, the &quot;corner stone&quot;, 
and destined to &quot;be raised up into a spiritual building&quot; (<I>1</I> <I>Pt </I>2:5 
ff.). The image introduces us to another aspect of the newness of Christian life 
coming from Baptism and described by the Second Vatican Council: &quot;By 
regeneration and the anointing of the Holy Spirit, the baptized are consecrated 
into a spiritual house&quot;(18).</P>
<P>The Holy Spirit &quot;anoints&quot; the baptized, sealing each with an indelible 
character (cf. 2 <I>Cor </I>1:21-22), and constituting each as a spiritual 
temple, that is, he fills this temple with the holy presence of God as a result 
of each person's being united and likened to Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>With this spiritual &quot;unction&quot;, Christians can repeat in an individual way the 
words of Jesus: &quot;The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me 
to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to captives 
and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, 
to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord&quot; (<I>Lk</I> 4:18-19; cf. <I>Is </I>
61:1-2). Thus with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in Baptism and 
Confirmation, the baptized share in the same mission of Jesus as the Christ, the 
Saviour-Messiah.</P>
<P><B><I>Sharers in the Priestly, Prophetic and Kingly Mission of Jesus Christ</I></B></P>
<P>14. Referring to the baptized as &quot;new born babes&quot;, the apostle Peter writes: 
&quot;Come to him, to that living stone, rejected by men but in God's sight chosen 
and precious; and like living stones be yourselves built into a spiritual house, 
to be a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through 
Jesus Christ ... you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's 
own people, that you may declare the wonderful deeds of him who called you out 
of darkness into his marvelous light&quot; (<I>1</I>

<I>Pt </I>2:4-5, 9).</P>
<P>A new aspect to the grace and dignity coming from Baptism is here introduced: 
the lay faithful participate, for their part, in the threefold mission of Christ 
as Priest, Prophet and King. This aspect has never been forgotten in the living 
tradition of the Church, as exemplified in the explanation which St. Augustine 
offers for Psalm 26:&quot;David was anointed king. In those days only a king and a 
priest were anointed. These two persons prefigured the one and only priest and 
king who was to come, Christ (the name &quot;Christ&quot; means &quot;anointed&quot;). Not only has 
our head been anointed but we, his body, have also been anointed ... therefore <I>
anointing </I>comes to all Christians, even though in Old Testament times it 
belonged only to two persons. Clearly we are the Body of Christ because we are 
all &quot;anointed&quot; and in him are &quot;christs&quot;, that is, &quot;anointed ones&quot;, as well as 
Christ himself, &quot;The Anointed One&quot;. In a certain way, then, it thus happens that 
with head and body the whole Christ is formed&quot;(19).</P>
<P>In the wake of the Second Vatican Council(20), at the beginning of my 
pastoral ministry, my aim was to emphasize forcefully the priestly, prophetic 
and kingly dignity of the entire People of God in the following words: &quot;He who 
was born of the Virgin Mary, the carpenter's Son -as he was thought to be-Son of 
the living God (confessed by Peter), has come to make us 'a kingdom of priests' 
The Second Vatican Council has reminded us of the mystery of this power and of 
the fact that the mission of Christ -Priest, Prophet-Teacher, King-continues in 
the Church. Everyone, the whole People of God, shares in this threefold 
mission&quot;(21).</P>
<P>With this Exhortation the lay faithful are invited to take up again and 
reread, meditate on and assimilate with renewed understanding and love, the rich 
and fruitful teaching of the Council which speaks of their participation in the 
threefold mission of Christ(22). Here in summary form are the essential elements 
of this teaching.</P>
<P>The lay faithful are sharers in the <I>priestly mission, </I>for which Jesus 
offered himself on the cross and continues to be offered in the celebration of 
the Eucharist for the glory of God and the salvation of humanity. Incorporated 
in Jesus Christ, the baptized are united to him and to his sacrifice in the 
offering they make of themselves and their daily activities (cf. <I>Rom </I>
12:1, 2). Speaking of the lay faithful the Council says: &quot;For their work, 
prayers and apostolic endeavours, their ordinary married and family life, their 
daily labour, their mental and physical relaxation, if carried out in the 
Spirit, and even the hardships of life if patiently borne-all of these become 
spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ (cf.<I> 1</I>

<I>Pt </I>2:5). During the celebration of the Eucharist these sacrifices are 
most lovingly offered to the Father along with the Lord's body. Thus as 
worshipers whose every deed is holy, the lay faithful consecrate the world 
itself to God&quot;(23).</P>
<P>Through their participation in the <I>prophetic mission </I>of Christ, &quot;who 
proclaimed the kingdom of his Father by the testimony of his life and by the 
power of his world&quot;(24), the lay faithful are given the ability and 
responsibility to accept the gospel in faith and to proclaim it in word and 
deed, without hesitating to courageously identify and denounce evil. United to 
Christ, the &quot;great prophet&quot; <I>(Lk </I>7:16), and in the Spirit made &quot;witnesses&quot; 
of the Risen Christ, the lay faithful are made sharers in the appreciation of 
the Church's supernatural faith, that &quot;cannot err in matters of belief&quot;(25) and 
sharers as well in the grace of the word (cf. <I>Acts </I>2:17-18; <I>Rev

</I>19:10). They are also called to allow the newness and the power of the 
gospel to shine out everyday in their family and social life, as well as to 
express patiently and courageously in the contradictions of the present age 
their hope of future glory even &quot;through the framework of their secular 
life&quot;(26).</P>
<P>Because the lay faithful belong to Christ, Lord and King of the Universe, 
they share in his <I>kingly mission </I>and are called by him to spread that 
Kingdom in history. They exercise their kingship as Christians, above all in the 
spiritual combat in which they seek to overcome in themselves the kingdom of sin 
(cf. <I>Rom </I>6:12), and then to make a gift of themselves so as to serve, in 
justice and in charity, Jesus who is himself present in all his brothers and 
sisters, above all in the very least (cf. <I>Mt </I>25:40).</P>
<P>But in particular the lay faithful are called to restore to creation all its 
original value. In ordering creation to the authentic well-being of humanity in 
an activity governed by the life of grace, they share in the exercise of the 
power with which the Risen Christ draws all things to himself and subjects them 
along with himself to the Father, so that God might be everything to everyone 
(cf. 1 <I>Cor </I>15:28; <I>Jn </I>12:32).</P>
<P>The participation of the lay faithful in the threefold mission of Christ as 
Priest, Prophet and King finds its source in the anointing of Baptism, its 
further development in Confirmation and its realization and dynamic sustenance 
in the Holy Eucharist. It is a participation given to each member of the lay 
faithful <I>individually, </I>in as much as each is one of the <I>many </I>who 
form the <I>one Body </I>of the Lord: in fact, Jesus showers his gifts upon the 
Church which is his Body and his Spouse. In such a way individuals are sharers 
in the threefold mission of Christ in virtue of their being members of the 
Church, as St. Peter clearly teaches, when he defines the baptized as &quot;a chosen 
race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's own people&quot; (<I>1</I>

<I>Pt </I>2:9). Precisely because it derives <I>from </I>Church <I>communion,

</I>the sharing of the lay faithful in the threefold mission of Christ requires 
that it be lived and realized <I>in communion </I>and <I>for the increase of 
communion itself. </I>Saint Augustine writes: &quot;As we call everyone 'Christians' 
in virtue of a mystical anointing, so we call everyone 'priests' because all are 
members of only one priesthood&quot;(27).</P>
<P><B><I>The Lay Faithful and Their Secular Character </I></B></P>
<P>15. The newness of the Christian life is the foundation and title for 
equality among all the baptized in Christ, for all the members of the People of 
God: &quot;As members, they share a common dignity from their rebirth in Christ, they 
have the same filial grace and the same vocation to perfection. They possess in 
common one salvation, one hope and one undivided charity&quot;(28). Because of the 
one dignity flowing from Baptism, each member of the lay faithful, together with 
ordained ministers and men and women religious, shares a responsibility for the 
Church's mission.</P>
<P>But among the lay faithful this one baptismal dignity takes on <I>a manner of 
life which sets a person apart, without, however, bringing about a separation

</I>from the ministerial priesthood or from men and women religious. The Second 
Vatican Council has described this manner of life as the &quot;secular character&quot;: 
&quot;The secular character is properly and particularly that of the lay 
faithful&quot;(29).</P>
<P>To understand properly the lay faithful's position in the Church in a 
complete, adequate and specific manner it is necesary to come to a deeper 
theological understanding of their secular character in light of God's plan of 
salvation and in the context of the mystery of the Church.</P>
<P>Pope Paul VI said the Church &quot;has an authentic secular dimension, inherent to 
her inner nature and mission, which is deeply rooted in the mystery of the Word 
Incarnate, and which is realized in different forms through her members&quot;(30).</P>
<P>The Church, in fact, lives in the world, even if she is not of the world (cf. <I>
Jn </I>17:16). She is sent to continue the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, 
which &quot;by its very nature concerns the salvation of humanity, and also involves 
the renewal of the whole temporal order&quot;(31).</P>
<P>Certainly <I>all the members </I>of the Church are sharers in this secular 
dimension but <I>in different ways. </I>In particular the sharing of the <I>lay 
faithful </I>has its own manner of realization and function, which, according to 
the Council, is &quot;properly and particularly&quot; theirs. Such a manner is designated 
with the expression &quot;secular character&quot;(32).</P>
<P>In fact the Council, in describing the lay faithful's situation in the 
secular world, points to it above all, as the place in which they receive their 
call from God: &quot;There they are called by God&quot;(33). This &quot;place&quot; is treated and 
presented in dynamic terms: the lay faithful &quot;live in the world, that is, in 
every one of the secular professions and occupations. They live in the ordinary 
circumstances of family and social life, from which the very fabric of their 
existence is woven&quot;(34). They are persons who live an ordinary life in the 
world: they study, they work, they form relationships as friends, professionals, 
members of society, cultures, etc. However, the Council considers their 
condition not simply an external and environmental framework, but as a reality <I>
destined to find in Jesus Christ the fullness of its meaning</I>(35). Indeed it 
leads to the affirmation that &quot;the Word made flesh willed to share in human 
fellowship ... He sanctified those human ties, especially family ones, from 
which social relationships arise, willingly submitting himself to the laws of 
his country. He chose to lead the life of an ordinary craftsman of his own time 
and place&quot;(36).</P>
<P><I>The &quot;world&quot; thus becomes the place and the means for the lay faithful to 
fulfill their Christian vocation, </I>because the world itself is destined to 
glorify God the Father in Christ. The Council is able then to indicate the 
proper and special sense of the divine vocation which is directed to the lay 
faithful. They are not called to abandon the position that they have in the 
world. Baptism does not take them from the world at all, as the apostle Paul 
points out: &quot;So, brethren, in whatever state each was called, there let him 
remain with God&quot; (<I>1</I> <I>Cor </I>7:24). On the contrary, he entrusts a 
vocation to them that properly concerns their situation in the world. The lay 
faithful, in fact, &quot;are called by God so that they, led by the spirit of the 
Gospel, might contribute to the sanctification of the world, as from within like 
leaven, by fulfilling their own particular duties. Thus, especially in this way 
of life, resplendent in faith, hope and charity they manifest Christ to 
others&quot;(37).Thus for the lay faithful, to be present and active in the world is 
not only an anthropological and sociological reality, but in a specific way, a 
theological and ecclesiological reality as well. In fact, in their situation in 
the world God manifests his plan and communicates to them their particular 
vocation of &quot;seeking the Kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and by 
ordering them according to the plan of God&quot;(38).</P>
<P>Precisely with this in mind the Synod Fathers said: &quot;The secular character of 
the lay faithful is not therefore to be defined only in a sociological sense, 
but most especially in a theological sense. The term <I>secular

</I>must be understood in light of the act of God the creator and redeemer, who 
has handed over the world to women and men, so that they may participate in the 
work of creation, free creation from the influence of sin and sanctify 
themselves in marriage or the celibate life, in a family, in a profession and in 
the various activities of society&quot;(39).</P>
<P>The lay faithful's <I>position in the Church, </I>then, comes to be 
fundamentally defined by their <I>newness in Christian life </I>and 
distinguished by their <I>secular character</I>(40).</P>
<P>The images taken from the gospel of salt, light and leaven, although 
indiscriminately applicable to all Jesus' disciples, are specifically applied to 
the lay faithful. They are particularly meaningful images because they speak not 
only of the deep involvement and the full participation of the lay faithful in 
the affairs of the earth, the world and the human community, but also and above 
all, they tell of the radical newness and unique character of an involvement and 
participation which has as its purpose the spreading of the Gospel that brings 
salvation.</P>
<P><B><I>Called to Holiness </I></B></P>
<P>16. We come to a full sense of the dignity of the lay faithful if we consider <I>
the prime and fundamental vocation </I>that the Father assigns to each of them 
in Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit: the vocation to holiness, that is, the 
perfection of charity. Holiness is the greatest testimony of the dignity 
conferred on a disciple of Christ.</P>
<P>The Second Vatican Council has significantly spoken on the universal call to 
holiness. It is possible to say that this call to holiness is precisely the 
basic charge entrusted to all the sons and daughters of the Church by a Council 
which intended to bring a renewal of Christian life based on the gospel(41). 
This charge is not a simple moral exhortation, but an <I>undeniable requirement 
arising from the mystery of the Church: she is the choice vine,
</I>whose branches live and grow with the same holy and life-giving energies 
that come from Christ; she is the Mystical Body, whose members share in the same 
life of holiness of the Head who is Christ; she is the Beloved Spouse of the 
Lord Jesus, who delivered himself up for her sanctification (cf. <I>Eph
</I>5:25 ff.). The Spirit that sanctified the human nature of Jesus in Mary's 
virginal womb (cf. 
<I>Lk </I>1:35) is the same Spirit that is abiding and working in the Church to 
communicate to her the holiness of the Son of God made man.</P>
<P>It is ever more urgent that today all Christians take up again the way of 
gospel renewal, welcoming in a spirit of generosity the invitation expressed by 
the apostle Peter &quot;to be holy in all conduct&quot; (<I>1 Pt</I> 1:15). The 1985 
Extraordinary Synod, twenty years after the Council, opportunely insisted on 
this urgency: &quot;Since the Church in Christ is a mystery, she ought to be 
considered the sign and instrument of holiness... Men and women saints have 
always been the source and origin of renewal in the most difficult circumstances 
in the Church's history. Today we have the greatest need of saints whom we must 
assiduously beg God to raise up&quot;(42).</P>
<P>Everyone in the Church, precisely because they are members, receive and 
thereby share in the common vocation to holiness. In the fullness of this title 
and on equal par with all other members of the Church, the lay faithful are 
called to holiness: &quot;All the faithful of Christ of whatever rank or status are 
called to the fullness of Christian life and to the perfection of charity&quot;(43). 
&quot;All of Christ's followers are invited and bound to pursue holiness and the 
perfect fulfillment of their own state of life&quot;(44).</P>
<P>The call to holiness is <I>rooted in Baptism </I>and proposed anew in the 
other Sacraments, principally in the <I>Eucharist. </I>Since Christians are 
reclothed in Christ Jesus and refreshed by his Spirit, they are &quot;holy&quot;. They 
therefore have the ability to manifest this holiness and the responsibility to 
bear witness to it in all that they do. The apostle Paul never tires of 
admonishing all Christians to live &quot;as is fitting among saints&quot; <I>(Eph 
</I>5:3).</P>
<P>Life according to the Spirit, whose fruit is holiness (cf. <I>Rom </I>6:22;<I>Gal

</I>5:22),<I> </I>stirs up every baptized person and requires each to <I>follow 
and imitate Jesus Christ, </I>in embracing the Beatitudes, in listening and 
meditating on the Word of God, in conscious and active participation in the 
liturgical and sacramental life of the Church, in personal prayer, in family or 
in community, in the hunger and thirst for justice, in the practice of the 
commandment of love in all circumstances of life and service to the brethren, 
especially the least, the poor and the suffering.</P>
<P><B><I>The Life of Holiness in the World</I></B></P>
<P>17. The vocation of the lay faithful to holiness implies that life according 
to the Spirit expresses itself in a particular way in their <I>involvement in 
temporal affairs </I>and in their <I>participation in earthly activities. </I>
Once again the apostle admonishes us: &quot;Whatever you do, in word or deed, do 
everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father 
through him&quot; (<I>Col </I>3:17). Applying the apostle's words to the lay 
faithful, the Council categorically affirms: &quot;Neither family concerns nor other 
secular affairs should be excluded from their religious programme of life&quot;(45). 
Likewise the Synod Fathers have said: &quot;The unity of life of the lay faithful is 
of the greatest importance: indeed they must be sanctified in everyday 
professional and social life. Therefore, to respond to their vocation, the lay 
faithful must see their daily activities as an occasion to join themselves to 
God, fulfill his will, serve other people and lead them to communion with God in 
Christ&quot;(46).</P>
<P>The vocation to holiness must be recognized and lived by the lay faithful, 
first of all as an undeniable and demanding obligation and as a shining example 
of the infinite love of the Father that has regenerated them in his own life of 
holiness. Such a vocation, then, ought to be called an <I>essential and 
inseparable element of the new life of Baptism, </I>and therefore an element 
which determines their dignity. At the same time the vocation to holiness is 
<I>intimately connected to mission </I>and to the responsibility entrusted to 
the lay faithful in the Church and in the world. In fact, that same holiness 
which is derived simply from their participation in the Church's holiness, 
represents their first and fundamental contribution to the building of the 
Church herself, who is the &quot;Communion of Saints&quot;. The eyes of faith behold a 
wonderful scene: that of a countless number of lay people, both women and men, 
busy at work in their daily life and activity, oftentimes far from view and 
quite unacclaimed by the world, unknown to the world's great personages but 
nonetheless looked upon in love by the Father, untiring labourers who work in 
the Lord's vineyard. Confident and steadfast through the power of God's grace, 
these are the humble yet great builders of the Kingdom of God in history.</P>
<P>Holiness, then, must be called a fundamental presupposition and an 
irreplaceable condition for everyone in fulfilling the mission of salvation 
within the Church. The Church's holiness is the hidden source and the infallible 
measure of the works of the apostolate and of the missionary effort. Only in the 
measure that the Church, Christ's Spouse, is loved by him and she, in turn, 
loves him, does she become a mother fruitful in the Spirit.</P>
<P>Again we take up the image from the gospel: the fruitfulness and the growth 
of the branches depends on their remaining united to the vine. &quot;As the branch 
cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, 
unless you abide in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in 
me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do 
nothing&quot; (<I>Jn</I> 15:4-5).</P>
<P>It is appropriate to recall here the solemn proclamation of beatification and 
canonization of lay men and women which took place during the month of the 
Synod. The entire People of God, and the lay faithful in particular, can find at 
this moment new models of holiness and new witnesses of heroic virtue lived in 
the ordinary everyday circumstances of human existence. The Synod Fathers have 
said: &quot;Particular Churches especially should be attentive to recognizing among 
their members the younger men and women of those Churches who have given witness 
to holiness in such conditions (everyday secular conditions and the conjugal 
state) and who can be an example for others, so that, if the case calls for it, 
they (the Churches) might propose them to be beatified and canonized&quot;(47).</P>
<P>At the end of these reflections intended to define the lay faithful's 
position in the Church, the celebrated admonition of Saint Leo the Great comes 
to mind: &quot;Acknowledge, O Christian, your dignity!&quot;(48). Saint Maximus, Bishop of 
Turin, in addressing those who had received the holy anointing of Baptism, 
repeats the same sentiments: &quot;Ponder the honor that has made you sharers in this 
mystery!&quot;(49). All the baptized are invited to hear once again the words of 
Saint Augustine: &quot;Let us rejoice and give thanks: we have not only become 
Christians, but Christ himself... Stand in awe and rejoice: We have become 
Christ&quot;(50).</P>
<P>The dignity as a Christian, the source of equality for all members of the 
Church, guarantees and fosters the spirit of <I>communion </I>and fellowship, 
and, at the same time, becomes the hidden dynamic force in the lay faithful's 
apostolate and mission. It is a <I>dignity, </I>however, <I>which brings 
demands, </I>the dignity of labourers called by the Lord to work in his 
vineyard: &quot;Upon all the lay faithful, then, rests the exalted duty of working to 
assure that each day the divine plan of salvation is further extended to every 
person, of every era, in every part of the earth&quot;(51).</P>

<P><B>ALL BRANCHES OF A SINGLE VINE</B><BR><B>The Participation of the Lay 
Faithtul in the Life of Church as Communion</B></P></CENTER>
<P><B><I>The Mystery of Church Communion</I></B></P>
<P>18. Again we turn to the words of Jesus: &quot;I am the true vine and my Father is 
the vinedresser... <I>Abide in me and I in you&quot; </I><I>(</I><I>Jn

</I><I>15:</I><I> </I>1, 4).</P>
<P>These simple words reveal the mystery of communion that serves as the 
unifying bond between the Lord and his disciples, between Christ and the 
baptized: a living and life-giving communion through which Christians no longer 
belong to themselves but are the Lord's very own, as the branches are one with 
the vine.</P>
<P>The communion of Christians with Jesus has the communion of God as Trinity, 
namely, the unity of the Son to the Father in the gift of the Holy Spirit, as 
its model and source, and is itself the means to achieve this communion: united 
to the Son in the Spirit's bond of love, Christians are united to the Father.</P>
<P>Jesus continues: &quot;<I>I am the vine, you are the branches&quot; </I><I>(</I><I>Jn

</I>15: 5). From the communion that Christians experience in Christ there 
immediately flows the communion which they experience with one another: all are 
branches of a single vine, namely, Christ. In this communion is the wonderful 
reflection and participation in the mystery of the intimate life of love in God 
as Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Spirit as revealed by the Lord Jesus. For this

<I>communion </I>Jesus prays: &quot;that they may all be one; even as you, Father, 
are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may 
believe that you have sent me&quot; (<I>Jn </I>17: 21).</P>
<P><I>Such communion is the very mystery </I><I>of </I><I>the Church, </I>as the 
Second Vatican Council recalls in the celebrated words of Saint Cyprian: &quot;The 
Church shines forth as 'a people made one with the unity of the Father, Son and 
Holy Spirit'&quot;(52). We are accustomed to recall this mystery of Church <I>
communion

</I>at the beginning of the celebration of the Eucharist, when the priest 
welcomes all with the greeting of the Apostle Paul: &quot;The grace of the Lord 
Jesus, the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all&quot; (2 <I>
Cor </I>13:13).</P>
<P>After having described the distinguishing features of the lay faithful on 
which their dignity rests, we must at this moment reflect on their mission and 
responsibility in the Church and in the world. A proper understanding of these 
aspects, however, can be found only in the living context of the Church as <I>
communion.</I></P>
<P><B><I>Vatican II and the Ecclesiology of Communion</I></B></P>
<P>19. At the Second Vatican Council the Church again proposed this central idea 
about herself, as the 1985 Extraordinary Synod recalls: &quot;The ecclesiology of <I>
communion is </I>a central and fundamental concept in the conciliar documents. <I>
Koinonia-communion, </I>finding its source in Sacred Scripture, was a concept 
held in great honour in the early Church and in the Oriental Churches, and this 
teaching endures to the present day. Much was done by the Second Vatican Council 
to bring about a clearer understanding of the Church as <I>communion </I>and its 
concrete application to life. What, then, does this complex word <I>'communion' </I>
mean? Its fundamental meaning speaks of the union with God brought about by 
Jesus Christ, in the Holy Spirit. The opportunity for such <I>communion is </I>
present in the Word of God and in the Sacraments. Baptism is the door and the 
foundation of <I>communion </I>in the Church. The Eucharist is the source and 
summit of the whole Christian life (cf.

<I>Lumen Gentium, </I>11). The Body of Christ in the Holy Eucharist 
sacramentalizes this communion, that is, it is a sign and actually brings about 
the intimate bonds of <I>communion</I> among all the faithful in the Body of 
Christ which is the Church (1 <I>Cor </I>10:16)&quot;(53).</P>
<P>On the day after the conclusion of the Council Pope Paul VI addressed the 
faithful in the following words: &quot;The Church is a <I>communion. </I>In this 
context what does <I>communion </I>mean? We refer you to the paragraph in the 
Catechism that speaks of the <I>sanctorum communionem, </I>'the Communion of 
Saints'. The meaning of the Church is a communion of saints. 'Communion' speaks 
of a double, lifegiving participation: the incorporation of Christians into the 
life of Christ, and the communication of that life of charity to the entire body 
of the Faithful, in this world and in the next, union with Christ and in Christ, 
and union among Christians, in the Church&quot;(54).</P>
<P>Vatican Council II has invited us to contemplate the mystery of the Church 
through biblical images which bring to light the reality of the Church as a <I>
communion

</I>with its inseparable dimensions: the communion of each Christian with Christ 
and the communion of all Christians with one another. There is the sheepfold, 
the flock, the vine, the spiritual building, the Holy City(55). Above all, there 
is the image of the <I>Body </I>as set forth by the Apostle Paul. Its doctrine 
finds a pleasing expression once again in various passages of the Council's 
documents(56). In its turn, the Council has looked again at the entire history 
of salvation and has reproposed the image of the Church as the <I>People </I><I>
of

</I><I>God: </I>&quot;It has pleased God to make people holy and to save them, not 
merely as individuals without any mutual bonds, but by making them into a single 
people, a people which acknowledges him in truth and serves him in 
holiness(57).&quot; From its opening lines, the Constitution <I>Lumen Gentium 
</I>summarizes this doctrine in a wonderful way: &quot;The Church in Christ is a kind 
of sacrament, that is, a sign and instrument of intimate union with God and of 
the unity of all the human race&quot;(58).</P>
<P><I>The reality </I><I>of </I><I>the Church as Communion is, </I>then, the 
integrating aspect, indeed <I>the central content </I><I>of </I><I>the 
&quot;mystery&quot;,

</I>or rather, the divine plan for the salvation of humanity. For this purpose 
ecclesial communion cannot be interpreted in a sufficient way if it is 
understood as simply a sociological or a psychological reality. The Church as 
<I>Communion </I>is the &quot;new&quot; People, the &quot;messianic&quot; People, the People that 
&quot;has, for its head, Christ... as its heritage, the dignity and freedom of God's 
Children... for its law, the new commandment to love as Christ loved us... for 
its goal, the kingdom of God... established by Christ as a communion of life, 
love and truth&quot;(59). The bonds that unite the members of the New People among 
themselves -and first of all with Christ-are not those of &quot;flesh and blood&quot;, but 
those of the spirit, more precisely those of the Holy Spirit, whom all the 
baptized have received (cf. <I>Joel </I>3:1).</P>
<P>In fact, that Spirit is the One who from eternity unites the one and 
undivided Trinity, that Spirit who &quot;in the fullness of time&quot; (<I>Gal 
</I>4:4) forever unites human nature to the Son of God, that same identical 
Spirit who in the course of Christian generations is the constant and 
never-ending source of communion in the Church.</P>
<P><B><I>An Organic Communion: Diversity and Complementarity </I></B></P>
<P>20. Ecclesial communion is more precisely likened to an &quot;organic&quot; communion, 
analogous to that of a living and functioning body. In fact, at one and the same 
time it is characterized by a <I>diversity </I>and a <I>complementarity

</I>of vocations and states in life, of ministries, of charisms and 
responsibilities. Because of this diversity and complementarity every member of 
the lay faithful is seen <I>in relation to the whole body </I>and offers a <I>
totally unique contribution </I>on behalf of the whole body.</P>
<P>Saint Paul insists in a particular way on the organic communion of the 
Mystical Body of Christ. We can hear his rich teaching echoed in the following 
synthesis from the Council: &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;-we read in the Constitution

<I>Lumen Gentium-</I>&quot;by communicating his Spirit to his brothers and sisters, 
called together from all peoples, made them mystically into his own body. In 
that body, the life of Christ is communicated to those who believe... As all the 
members of the human body, though they are many, form one body, so also are the 
Faithful in Christ (cf. 1 <I>Cor </I>12:12). Also, in the building up of 
Christ's body there is a diversity of members and functions. There is only one 
Spirit who, according to his own richness and the necessities of service, 
distributes his different gifts for the welfare of the Church (cf. 1
<I>Cor 
</I>12:1-11). Among these gifts comes in the first place the grace given to the 
apostles to whose authority the Spirit himself subjects even those who are 
endowed with charisms (cf. 1 <I>Cor </I>14). Furthermore it is this same Spirit, 
who through his power and through the intimate bond between the members, 
produces and urges love among the faithful. Consequently, if one member suffers 
anything, all the members suffer it too, and if one member is honoured, all 
members together rejoice (cf. 1 <I>Cor </I>12:26)&quot;(60).</P>
<P><I>One and the same Spirit is always the dynamic principle of diversity and 
unity </I>in the Church. Once again we read in the Constitution <I>Lumen 
Gentium, </I>&quot;In order that we might be unceasingly renewed in him (cf. 
<I>Eph </I>4:23), he has shared with us his Spirit who, existing as one and the 
same being in the head and in the members, gives life to, unifies and moves the 
whole body. This he does in such a way that his work could be compared by the 
Fathers to the function which the soul as the principle of life fulfills in the 
human body&quot;(60). And in another particularly significant text which is helpful 
in understanding not only the organic nature proper to ecclesial communion but 
also its aspect of growth toward perfect communion, the Council writes: &quot;The 
Spirit dwells in the Church and in the hearts of the Faithful, as in a temple 
(cf. 1 <I>Cor </I>3:16; 6:19). In them he prays and bears witness that they are 
adopted sons (cf. <I>Gal </I>4:6; <I>Rom </I>8:15-16, 26). Guiding the Church in 
the way of all truth (cf. <I>Jn </I>16:13) and unifying her in communion and in 
the works of service, he bestows upon her varied hierarchical and charismatic 
gifts and adorns her with the fruits of his grace (cf. <I>Eph </I>4:11-12; 1 <I>
Cor </I>12:4; <I>Gal </I>5:22). By the power of the Gospel he makes the Church 
grow, perpetually renews her, and leads her to perfect union with her Spouse. 
The Spirit and the Bride both say to the Lord Jesus, 'Come!' (cf. <I>Rev </I>
22:17)&quot;(62).</P>
<P><I>Church communion then is a gift, a great gift of the Holy Spirit, </I>to 
be gratefully accepted by the lay faithful, and at the same time to be lived 
with a deep sense of responsibility. This is concretely realized through their 
participation in the life and mission of the Church, to whose service the lay 
faithful put their varied and complementary ministries and charisms.</P>
<P>A member of the lay faithful &quot;can never remain in isolation from the 
community, but must live in a continual interaction with others, with a lively 
sense of fellowship, rejoicing in an equal dignity and common commitment to 
bring to fruition the immense treasure that each has inherited. The Spirit of 
the Lord gives a vast variety of charisms, inviting people to assume different 
ministries and forms of service and reminding them, as he reminds all people in 
their relationship in the Church, that what distinguishes persons is <I>not an 
increase in dignity, </I>but <I>a special and complementary capacity for 
service... </I>Thus, the charisms, the ministries, the different forms of 
service exercised by the lay faithful exist in communion and on behalf of 
communion. They are treasures that complement one another for the good of all 
and are under the wise guidance of their Pastors&quot;(63).</P>
<P><B><I>Ministries and Charisms, the Spirit's Gifts to the Church</I></B></P>
<P>21. The Second Vatican Council speaks of the ministries and charisms as the 
gifts of the Holy Spirit which are given for the building up of the Body of 
Christ and for its mission of salvation in the world(64). Indeed, the Church is 
directed and guided by the Holy Spirit, who lavishes diverse hierarchical and 
charismatic gifts on all the baptized, calling them to be, each in an individual 
way, active and coresponsible.</P>
<P>We now turn our thoughts to ministries and charisms as they directly relate 
to the lay faithful and to their participation in the life of Church-Communion.</P>
<P><I>Ministries, Offices and Roles</I></P>
<P>The ministries which exist and are at work at this time in the Church are 
all, even in their variety of forms, a participation in Jesus Christ's own 
ministry as the Good Shepherd who lays down his life for the sheep (cf. <I>Jn</I>
 10:11), the humble servant who gives himself without reserve for the salvation 
of all (cf. <I>Mk </I>10:45). The Apostle Paul is quite clear in speaking about 
the ministerial constitution of the Church in apostolic times. In his First 
Letter to the Corinthians he writes: &quot;And God has appointed in the Church first 
apostles, second prophets, third teachers...&quot; (1 <I>Cor </I>12:28). In his 
Letter to the Ephesians we read: &quot;But the grace was given to each of us 
according to the measure of Christ's gift... And his gifts were that some should 
be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to 
equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, 
until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of 
God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ&quot; 
(<I>Eph </I>4:7, 11-13; cf. <I>Rom </I>12:4-8). These and other New Testament 
texts indicate the diversity of ministries as well as of gifts and ecclesial 
tasks.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B><I>The Ministries Derived from Holy Orders</I></B></P>
<P>22. In a primary position in the Church are the <I>ordained ministries, 
</I>that is, the ministries <I>that come from the Sacrament of Orders. </I>In 
fact, with the mandate to make disciples of all nations (cf. <I>Mt </I>28:19), 
the Lord Jesus chose and constituted the apostles-seed of the People of the New 
Covenant and origin of the Hierarchy (65)-to form and to rule the priestly 
people. The mission of the Apostles, which the Lord Jesus continues to entrust 
to the Pastors of his people, is a true service, significantly referred to in 
Sacred Scripture as <I>&quot;diakonia&quot;, </I>namely, service or ministry. The 
ministries receive the charism of the Holy Spirit from the Risen Christ, in 
uninterrupted succession from the apostles, through the Sacrament of Orders: 
from him they receive the authority and sacred power to serve the Church, acting 
in <I>persona Christi Capitis </I>(in the person of Christ, the Head)(66) and to 
gather her in the Holy Spirit through the Gospel and the Sacraments.</P>
<P>The ordained ministries, apart from the persons who receive them, are a grace 
for the entire Church. These ministries express and realize a participation in 
the priesthood of Jesus Christ that is different, not simply in degree but in 
essence, from the participation given to all the lay faithful through Baptism 
and Confirmation. On the other hand, the ministerial priesthood, as the Second 
Vatican Council recalls, essentially has the royal priesthood of all the 
faithful as its aim and is ordered to it(67).</P>
<P>For this reason, so as to assure and to increase communion in the Church, 
particularly in those places where there is a diversity and complementarity of 
ministries, Pastors must always acknowledge that their ministry is fundamentally 
ordered to the service of the entire People of God (cf. <I>Heb </I>5:1). The lay 
faithful, in turn, must acknowledge that the ministerial priesthood is totally 
necessary for their participation in the mission in the Church(68).</P>
<P></P>
<P><B><I>The Ministries, Offices and Roles of the Lay Faithful</I></B></P>
<P>23. The Church's mission of salvation in the world is realized not only by 
the ministers in virtue of the Sacrament of Orders but also by all the lay 
faithful; indeed, because of their Baptismal state and their specific vocation, 
in the measure proper to each person, the lay faithful participate in the 
priestly, prophetic and kingly mission of Christ.</P>
<P>The Pastors, therefore, ought to acknowledge and foster the ministries, the 
offices and roles of the lay faithful that find their <I>foundation in the 
Sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation, </I>indeed, for a good many of them, 
<I>in the Sacrament of Matrimony.</I></P>
<P>When necessity and expediency in the Church require it, the Pastors, 
according to established norms from universal law, can entrust to the lay 
faithful certain offices and roles that are connected to their pastoral ministry 
but do not require the character of Orders. The Code of Canon Law states: &quot; When 
the necessity of the Church warrants it and when ministers are lacking, lay 
persons, even if they are not lectors or acolytes, can also supply for certain 
of their offices, namely, to exercise the ministry of the word, to preside over 
liturgical prayers, to confer Baptism, and to distribute Holy Communion in 
accord with the prescriptions of the law&quot;(69). However, <I>the exercise of such 
tasks does not make Pastors of the lay faithful: </I>in fact, a person is not a 
minister simply in performing a task, but through sacramental ordination. Only 
the Sacrament of Orders gives the ordained minister a particular participation 
in the office of Christ, the Shepherd and Head, and in his Eternal 
Priesthood(70). The task exercised in virtue of supply takes its legitimacy 
formally and immediately from the official deputation given by the Pastors, as 
well as from its concrete exercise under the guidance of ecclesiastical 
authority(71).</P>
<P>The recent Synodal Assembly has provided an extensive and meaningful overview 
of the situation in the Church on the ministries, offices and roles of the 
baptized. The Fathers have manifested a deep appreciation for the contribution 
of the lay faithful, both women and men, in the work of the apostolate, in 
evangelization, sanctification and the Christian animation of temporal affairs, 
as well as their generous willingness to supply in situations of emergency and 
chronic necessity(72).</P>
<P>Following the liturgical renewal promoted by the Council, the lay faithful 
themselves have acquired a more lively awareness of the tasks that they fulfill 
in the liturgical assembly and its preparation, and have become more widely 
disposed to fulfill them: the liturgical celebration, in fact, is a sacred 
action not simply of the clergy, but of the entire assembly. It is, therefore, 
natural that the tasks not proper to the ordained ministers be fulfilled by the 
lay faithful(73). In this way there is a natural transition from an effective 
involvement of the lay faithful in the liturgical action to that of announcing 
the word of God and pastoral care(74).</P>
<P>In the same Synod Assembly, however, a critical judgment was voiced along 
with these positive elements, about a too-indiscriminate use of the word 
&quot;ministry&quot;, the confusion and the equating of the common priesthood and the 
ministerial priesthood, the lack of observance of ecclesiastical laws and norms, 
the arbitrary interpretation of the concept of &quot;supply&quot;, the tendency towards a 
&quot;clericalization&quot; of the lay faithful and the risk of creating, in reality, an 
ecclesial structure of parallel service to that founded on the Sacrament of 
Orders.</P>
<P>Precisely to overcome these dangers the Synod Fathers have insisted on the 
necessity to express with greater clarity, and with a more precise 
terminology(75), both <I>the unity of the Church's mission </I>in which all the 
baptized participate, and the substantial <I>diversity of the ministry </I>of 
Pastors which is rooted in the Sacrament of Orders, all the while respecting the 
other ministries, offices and roles in the Church, which are rooted in the 
Sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation.</P>
<P>In the first place, then, it is necessary that in acknowledging and in 
conferring various ministries, offices and roles on the lay faithful, the 
Pastors exercise the maximum care to institute them on the basis of Baptism in 
which these tasks are rooted. It is also necessary that Pastors guard against a 
facile yet abusive recourse to a presumed &quot;situation of emergency&quot; or to &quot;supply 
by necessity&quot;, where objectively this does not exist or where alternative 
possibilities could exist through better pastoral planning.</P>
<P>The various ministries, offices and roles that the lay faithful can 
legitimately fulfill in the liturgy, in the transmission of the faith, and in 
the pastoral structure of the Church, ought to be exercised <I>in conformity to 
their specific lay vocation, </I>which is different from that of the sacred 
ministry. In this regard the Exhortation <I>Evangelii Nuntiandi, </I>that had 
such a great part in stimulating the varied collaboration of the lay faithful in 
the Church's life and mission of spreading the gospel, recalls that &quot;their own 
field of evangelizing activity is the vast and complicated world of politics, 
society and economics, as well as the world of culture, of the sciences and the 
arts, of international life, of the mass media. It also includes other realities 
which are open to evangelization, such as human love, the family, the education 
of children and adolescents, professional work, and suffering. The more 
Gospel-inspired lay people there are engaged in these realities, clearly 
involved in them, competent to promote them and conscious that they must 
exercise to the full their Christian powers which are often repressed and 
buried, the more these realities will be at the service of the Kingdom of God 
and therefore at the service of salvation in Jesus Christ, without in any way 
losing or sacrificing their human content but rather pointing to a transcendent 
dimension which is often disregarded&quot;(76).</P>
<P>In the course of Synod work the Fathers devoted much attention to the <I>
Lectorate

</I>and the <I>Acolytate. </I>While in the past these ministries existed in the 
Latin Church only as spiritual steps on route to the ordained ministry, with the 
<I>motu proprio </I>of Paul VI,<I> Ministeria Quaedam </I>(15 August 1972), they 
assumed an autonomy and stability, as well as a possibility of their being given 
to the lay faithful, albeit, only to men. This same fact is expressed in the new 
Code of Canon Law(77). At this time the Synod Fathers expressed the desire that 
&quot;the <I>motu proprio Ministeria Quaedam </I>be reconsidered, bearing in mind the 
present practice of local churches and above all indicating criteria which ought 
to be used in choosing those destined for each ministry&quot;(78).</P>
<P>In this regard a Commission was established to respond to this desire voiced 
by the Synod Fathers, specifically to provide an in-depth study of the various 
theological, liturgical, juridical and pastoral consideration which are 
associated with the great increase today of the ministries entrusted to the lay 
faithful.</P>
<P>While the conclusions of the Commission's study are awaited, a more ordered 
and fruitful ecclesial practice of the ministries entrusted to the lay faithful 
can be achieved if all the particular Churches faithfully respect the above 
mentioned theological principles, especially the essential difference between 
the ministerial priesthood and the common priesthood, and the difference between 
the ministries derived from the Sacrament of Orders and those derived from the 
Sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation.</P>
<P><B><I>Charisms</I></B></P>
<P>24. The Holy Spirit, while bestowing diverse ministries in Church communion, 
enriches it still further with particular gifts or promptings of grace, called

<I>charisms. </I>These can take a great variety of forms, both as a 
manifestation of the absolute freedom of the Spirit who abundantly supplies 
them, and as a response to the varied needs of the Church in history. The 
description and the classification given to these gifts in the New Testament are 
an indication of their rich variety. &quot;To each is given the manifestation of the 
Spirit for the common good. To one is given through the Spirit the utterance of 
wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, 
to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one 
Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the 
ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to 
another the interpretation of tongues&quot; (1 <I>Cor </I>12:7-10; cf. 1 
<I>Cor </I>12:4-6, 28-31; <I>Rom </I>12:6-8; 1 <I>Pt</I> 4:10-11).</P>
<P>Whether they be exceptional and great or simple and ordinary, the charisms 
are <I>graces of the Holy Spirit that have, </I>directly or indirectly, <I>a 
usefulness for the ecclesial community, </I>ordered as they are to the building 
up of the Church, to the well-being of humanity and to the needs of the world.</P>
<P>Even in our own times there is no lack of a fruitful manifestation of various 
charisms among the faithful, women and men. These charisms are given to 
individual persons, and can even be shared by others in such ways as to continue 
in time a precious and effective heritage, serving as a source of a particular 
spiritual affinity among persons. In referring to the apostolate of the lay 
faithful the Second Vatican Council writes: &quot;For the exercise of the apostolate 
the Holy Spirit who sanctifies the People of God through the ministry and the 
sacraments gives the faithful special gifts as well (cf. 1 <I>Cor </I>12:7), 
'allotting them to each one as he wills' (cf. 1 <I>Cor </I>12:11), so that each 
might place 'at the service of others the grace received' and become 'good 
stewards of God's varied grace' (1 <I>Pt </I>4:10), and build up thereby the 
whole body in charity (cf. <I>Eph </I>4:16)&quot;(79).</P>
<P>By a logic which looks to the divine source of this giving, as the Council 
recalls(80), the gifts of the Spirit demand that those who have received them 
exercise them for the growth of the whole Church.</P>
<P>The charisms are <I>received in gratitude </I>both on the part of the one who 
receives them, and also on the part of the entire Church. They are in fact a 
singularly rich source of grace for the vitality of the apostolate and for the 
holiness of the whole Body of Christ, provided that they be gifts that come 
truly from the Spirit and are exercised in full conformity with the authentic 
promptings of the Spirit. In this sense the <I>discernment of charisms </I>is 
always necessary. Indeed, the Synod Fathers have stated: &quot;The action of the Holy 
Spirit, who breathes where he will, is not always easily recognized and 
received. We know that God acts in all Christians, and we are aware of the 
benefits which flow from charisms both for individuals and for the whole 
Christian community. Nevertheless, at the same time we are also aware of the 
power of sin and how it can disturb and confuse the life of the faithful and of 
the community&quot;(81).</P>
<P>For this reason no charism dispenses a person from reference and submission 
to the <I>Pastors of the Church. </I>The Council clearly states: &quot;Judgment as to 
their (charisms) genuineness and proper use belongs to those who preside over 
the Church, and to whose special competence it belongs, not indeed to extinguish 
the Spirit, but to test all things and hold fast to what is good (cf. 1 <I>Thess </I>
5:12 and 19-21)&quot;(82), so that all the charisms might work together, in their 
diversity and complementarity, for the common good(83).</P>
<P><B><I>The Lay Faithful's Participation in the Life of the Church</I></B></P>
<P>25. The lay faithful participate in the life of the Church not only in 
exercising their tasks and charisms, but also in many other ways.</P>
<P>Such participation finds its first and necessary expression in the life and 
mission of the <I>particular Church, </I>in the diocese in which &quot;the Church of 
Christ, one, holy, catholic and apostolic, is truly present and at work&quot;(84).</P>
<P><I>The Particular Churches and the Universal Church</I></P>
<P>For an adequate participation in ecclesial life the lay faithful absolutely 
need to have a clear and precise vision of the <I>particular Church with its 
primordial bond to the universal Church. </I>The particular Church does not come 
about from a kind of fragmentation of the universal Church, nor does the 
universal Church come about by a simple amalgamation of particular Churches. But 
there is a real, essential and constant bond uniting each of them and this is 
why the universal Church exists and is manifested in the particular Churches. 
For this reason the Council says that the particular Churches &quot;are constituted 
after the model of the universal Church; it is in and from these particular 
Churches that there come into being the one and unique Catholic Church&quot;(85).</P>
<P>The same Council strongly encourages the lay faithful actively to live out 
their belonging to the particular Church, while at the same time assuming an 
ever-increasing &quot;catholic&quot; spirit: &quot;Let the lay faithful constantly foster&quot;-we 
read in the Decree on the Apostolate of Lay People- &quot;a feeling for their own 
diocese, of which the parish is a kind of cell, and be always ready at their 
bishops' invitation to participate in diocesan projects. Indeed, if the needs of 
cities and rural areas are to be met, lay people should not limit their 
cooperation to the parochial or diocesan boundaries but strive to extend it to 
interparochial, interdiocesan, national and international fields, the more so 
because the daily increase in population mobility, the growth of mutual bonds, 
and the ease of communication no longer allow any sector of society to remain 
closed in upon itself. Thus they should be concerned about the needs of the 
People of God scattered throughout the world&quot;(86).</P>
<P>In this sense, the recent Synod has favored the creation of <I>Diocesan 
Pastoral Councils, </I>as a recourse at opportune times. In fact, on a diocesan 
level this structure could be the principle form of collaboration, dialogue, and 
discernment as well. The participation of the lay faithful in these Councils can 
broaden resources in consultation and the principle of collaboration-and in 
certain instances also in decision-making - if applied in a broad and determined 
manner(87).</P>
<P>The participation of the lay faithful in <I>Diocesan Synods </I>and in <I>
local Councils, </I>whether provincial or plenary, is envisioned by the Code of 
Canon Law(88). These structures could contribute to Church communion and the 
mission of the particular Church, both in its own surroundings and in relation 
to the other particular Churches of the ecclesiastical province or Episcopal 
Conference.</P>
<P>Episcopal Conferences are called to evaluate the most oportune way of 
developing the consultation and the collaboration of the lay faithful, women and 
men, at a national or regional level, so that they may consider well the 
problems they share and manifest better the communion of the whole Church(89).</P>
<P><B><I>The Parish</I></B></P>
<P>26. The ecclesial community, while always having a universal dimension, finds 
its most immediate and visible expression in the <I>parish. </I>It is there that 
the Church is seen locally. In a certain sense it is the <I>Church living in the 
midst </I><I>of </I><I>the homes </I><I>of </I><I>her sons and daughters</I>(90).</P>
<P>It is necessary that in light of the faith all rediscover the true meaning of 
the parish, that is, the place where the very &quot;mystery&quot; of the Church is present 
and at work, even if at times it is lacking persons and means, even if at other 
times it might be scattered over vast territories or almost not to be found in 
crowded and chaotic modern sections of cities. The parish is not principally a 
structure, a territory, or a building, but rather, &quot;the family of God, a 
fellowship afire with a unifying spirit&quot;(91), &quot;a familial and welcoming 
home&quot;(92), the &quot;community of the faithful&quot;(93). Plainly and simply, the parish 
is founded on a theological reality, because it is a <I>Eucharistic </I><I>
community</I>(94). This means that the parish is a community properly suited for 
celebrating the Eucharist, the living source for its upbuilding and the 
sacramental bond of its being in full communion with the whole Church. Such 
suitableness is rooted in the fact that the parish is a <I>community of faith </I>
and an <I>organic community, </I>that is, constituted by the ordained ministers 
and other Christians, in which the pastor-who represents the diocesan 
bishop(95)-is the hierarchical bond with the entire particular Church.</P>
<P>Since the Church's task in our day is so great its accomplishment cannot be 
left to the parish alone. For this reason the Code of Canon Law provides for 
forms of collaboration among parishes in a given territory(96) and recommends to 
the bishop's care the various groups of the Christian Faithful, even the 
unbaptized who are not under his ordinary pastoral care(97). There are many 
other places and forms of association through which the Church can be present 
and at work. All are necessary to carry out the word and grace of the Gospel and 
to correspond to the various circumstances of life in which people find 
themselves today. In a similar way there exist in the areas of culture, society, 
education, professions, etc. many other ways for spreading the faith and other 
settings for the apostolate which cannot have the parish as their center and 
origin. Nevertheless, in our day the parish still enjoys a new and promising 
season. At the beginning of his pontificate, Paul VI addressed the Roman clergy 
in these words: &quot;We believe simply that this old and venerable structure of the 
parish has an indispensable mission of great contemporary importance: to create 
the basic community of the Christian people; to initiate and gather the people 
in the accustomed expression of liturgical life; to conserve and renew the faith 
in the people of today; to serve as the school for teaching the salvific message 
of Christ; to put solidarity in practice and work the humble charity of good and 
brotherly works&quot;(98).</P>
<P>The Synod Fathers for their part have given much attention to the present 
state of many parishes and have called for a <I>greater effort in their renewal: </I>
&quot;Many parishes, whether established in regions affcted by urban progress or in 
missionary territory, cannot do their work effectively because they lack 
material resources or ordained men or are too big geographically or because of 
the particular circumstances of some Christians (e.g. exiles and migrants). So 
that all parishes of this kind may be truly communities of Christians, local 
ecclesial authorities ought to foster the following: <I>a) </I>adaptation of 
parish structures according to the full flexibility granted by canon law, 
especially in promoting participation by the lay faithfulinpastoral 
responsibilities; <I>b) </I>small, basic or so-called &quot;living&quot; communities, 
where the faithful can communicate the Word of God and express it in service and 
love to one another; these communities are true expressions of ecclesial 
communion and centers of evangelization, in communion with their pastors&quot;(99). 
For the renewal of parishes and for a better assurance of their effectiveness in 
work, various forms of cooperation even on the institutional level ought to be 
fostered among diverse parishes in the same area.</P>
<P><B><I>The Apostolic Commitment in the Parish</I></B></P>
<P>27. It is now necessary to look more closely at the communion and 
participation of the lay faithful in parish life. In this regard all lay men and 
women are called to give greater attention to a particularly meaningful, 
stirring and incisive passage from the Council: &quot;Their activity within Church 
communities is so necessary that without it the apostolate of the Pastors is 
generally unable to achieve its full effectiveness&quot;(100).</P>
<P>This is indeed a particularly important affirmation, which evidently must be 
interpreted in light of the &quot;ecclesiology of communion&quot;. Ministries and 
charisms, being diverse and complementary, are all necessary for the Church to 
grow, each in its own way.</P>
<P>The lay faithful ought to be ever more convinced of the special meaning that 
their commitment to the apostolate takes on in their parish. Once again the 
Council authoritatively places it in relief: &quot;The parish offers an outstanding 
example of the apostolate on the community level, inasmuch as it brings together 
the many human differences found within its boundaries and draws them into the 
universality of the Church. The lay faithful should accustom themselves to 
working in the parish in close union with their priests, bringing to the Church 
community their own and the world's problems as well as questions concerning 
human salvation, all of which need to be examined together and solved through 
general discussion. As far as possible the lay faithful ought to collaborate in 
every apostolic and missionary undertaking sponsored by their own ecclesial 
family&quot;(101).</P>
<P>The Council's mention of examining and solving pastoral problems &quot;by general 
discussion&quot; ought to find its adequate and structured development through a more 
convinced, extensive and decided appreciation for &quot;Parish Pastoral Councils&quot;, on 
which the Synod Fathers have rightly insisted(102).</P>
<P>In the present circumstances the lay faithful have the ability to do very 
much and, therefore, ought to do very much towards the growth of an authentic 
ecclesial communion in their parishes in order to reawaken missionary zeal 
towards nonbelievers and believers themselves who have abandoned the faith or 
grown lax in the Christian life.</P>
<P>If indeed, the parish is the Church placed in the neighborhoods of humanity, 
it lives and is at work through being deeply inserted in human society and 
intimately bound up with its aspirations and its dramatic events. Oftentimes the 
social context, especially in certain countries and environments, is violently 
shaken by elements of disintegration and de-humanization. The individual is lost 
and disoriented, but there always remains in the human heart the desire to 
experience and cultivate caring and personal relationships. The response to such 
a desire can come from the parish, when, with the lay faithful's participation, 
it adheres to its fundamental vocation and mission, that is, to be a &quot;place&quot; in 
the world for the community of believers to gather together as a &quot;sign&quot; and 
&quot;instrument&quot; of the vocation of all to communion, in a word, to be a house of 
welcome to all and a place of service to all, or, as Pope John XXIII was fond of 
saying, to be the &quot;village fountain&quot; to which all would have recourse in their 
thirst.</P>
<P><B><I>The Forms of Participation in the Life of the Church </I></B></P>
<P>28. The lay faithful together with the clergy and women and men religious, 
make up the one People of God and the Body of Christ.</P>
<P>Being &quot;members&quot; of the Church takes nothing away from the fact that each 
Christian as an individual is &quot;unique and irrepeatable&quot;. On the contrary, this 
belonging guarantees and fosters the profound sense of that uniqueness and 
irrepeatability, in so far as these very qualities are the source of variety and 
richness for the whole Church. Therefore, God calls the individual in Jesus 
Christ, each one personally by name. In this sense, the Lord's words &quot;You go 
into my vineyard too&quot;, directed to the Church as a whole, come specially 
addressed to each member individually.</P>
<P>Because of each member's unique and irrepeatable character, that is, one's 
identity and actions as a person, each individual is placed at the service of 
the growth of the ecclesial community while, at the same time, singularly 
receiving and sharing in the common richness of all the Church. This is the 
&quot;Communion of Saints&quot; which we profess in the Creed. <I>The good of all becomes 
the good of each one and the good of each one becomes the good of all. </I>&quot;In 
the Holy Church&quot;, writes Saint Gregory the Great, &quot;all are nourished by each one 
and each ones is nourished by all&quot;(103).</P>
<P><I>Individual Forms of Participation</I></P>
<P>Above all, each member of the lay faithful should always be <I>fully aware of 
being a &quot;member of the Church&quot; </I>yet entrusted with a unique task which cannot 
be done by another and which is to be fulfilled for the good of all. From this 
perspective the Council's insistence on the <I>absolute necessity of an 
apostolate exercised by the individual </I>takes on its full meaning: &quot;The 
apostolate exercised by the individual-which flows abundantly from a truly 
Christian life (cf. <I>Jn </I>4:<I> </I>11)-is the origin and condition of the 
whole lay apostolate, even in its organized expression, and admits no 
substitute. Regardless of circumstance, all lay persons (including those who 
have no opportunity or possibility for collaboration in associations) are called 
to this type of apostolate and obliged to engage in it. Such an apostolate is 
useful at all times and places, but in certain circumstances it is the only one 
available and feasible&quot;(104).</P>
<P>In the apostolate exercised by the individual, great riches are waiting to be 
discovered through an intensification of the missionary effort of each of the 
lay faithful. Such an individual form of apostolate can contribute greatly to a

<I>more extensive </I>spreading of the Gospel, indeed it can reach as many 
places as there are daily lives of individual members of the lay faithful. 
Furthermore, the spread of the gospel will be <I>continual, </I>since a person's 
life and faith will be one. Likewise the spread of the gospel will be 
particularly <I>incisive, </I>because in sharing fully in the unique conditions 
of the life, work, difficulties and hopes of their sisters and brothers, the lay 
faithful will be able to reach the hearts of their neighbors, friends, and 
colleagues, opening them to a full sense of human existence, that is, to 
communion with God and with all people.</P>
<P><I><B>Group Forms of Participation</B></I></P>
<P>29. Church communion, already present and at work in the activities of the 
individual, finds its specific expression in the lay faithful's working together 
in groups, that is, in activities done with others in the course of their 
responsible participation in the life and mission of the Church.</P>
<P>In recent days the phenomenon of lay people associating among themselves has 
taken on a character of particular variety and vitality. In some ways lay 
associations have always been present throughout the Church's history as various 
confraternities, third orders and sodalities testify even today. However, in 
modern times such lay groups have received a special stimulus, resulting in the 
birth and spread of a multiplicity of group forms: associations, groups, 
communities, movements. We can speak of a <I>new era of group endeavours </I>of 
the lay faithful. In fact, &quot;alongside the traditional forming of associations, 
and at times coming from their very roots, movements and new sodalities have 
sprouted, with a specific feature and purpose, so great is the richness and the 
versatility of resources that the Holy Spirit nourishes in the ecclesial 
community, and so great is the capacity of initiative and the generosity of our 
lay people&quot;(105).</P>
<P>Oftentimes these lay groups show themselves to be <I>very diverse </I>from 
one another in various aspects, in their external structures, in their 
procedures and training methods, and in the fields in which they work. However, 
they all come together in an all-inclusive and <I>profound convergence </I>when 
viewed from the perspective of their common purpose, that is, the responsible 
participation of all of them in the Church'smission of carrying forth the Gospel 
of Christ, the source of hope for humanity and the renewal of society.</P>
<P>The actual formation of groups of the lay faithful for spiritual purposes or 
for apostolic work comes from various sources and corresponds to different 
demands. In fact, their formation itself expresses the social nature of the 
person and for this reason leads to a more extensive and incisive effectiveness 
in work. In reality, a &quot;cultural&quot; effect can be accomplished through work done 
not so much by an individual alone but by an individual as &quot;a social being&quot;, 
that is, as a member of a group, of a community, of an association, or of a 
movement. Such work is, then, the source and stimulus leading to the 
transformation of the surroundings and society as well as the fruit and sign of 
every other transformation in this regard. This is particularly true in the 
context of a pluralistic and fragmented society-the case in so many parts of the 
world today-and in light of the problems which have become greatly complex and 
difficult. On the other hand, in a secularized world, above all, the various 
group forms of the apostolate can represent for many a precious help for the 
Christian life in remaining faithful to the demands of the gospel and to the 
commitment to the Church's mission and the apostolate.</P>
<P>Beyond this, the profound reason that justifies and demands the lay 
faithful's forming of lay groups comes from a theology <I>based on ecclesiology, </I>
as the Second Vatican Council clearly acknowledged in referring to the group 
apostolate as a &quot;sign of communion and of unity of the Church of Christ&quot;(106).</P>
<P>It is a &quot;sign&quot; that must be manifested in relation to &quot;communion&quot; both in the 
internal and external aspects of the various group forms and in the wider 
context of the Christian community. As mentioned, this reason based on 
ecclesiology explains, on one hand, the &quot;right&quot; of lay associations to form, and 
on the other, the necessity of &quot;criteria&quot; for discerning the authenticity of the 
forms which such groups take in the Church.</P>
<P>First of all, the <I>freedom for lay people in the Church to form such groups </I>
is to be acknowledged. Such liberty is a true and proper right that is not 
derived from any kind of &quot;concession&quot; by authority, but flows from the Sacrament 
of Baptism, which calls the lay faithful to participate actively in the Church's 
communion and mission. In this regard the Council is quite clear: &quot;As long as 
the proper relationship is kept to Church authority, the lay faithful have the 
right to found and run such associations and to join those already 
existing&quot;(107). A citation from the recently published Code of Canon Law affirms 
it as well: &quot;The Christian faithful are at liberty to found and govern 
associations for charitable and religious purposes or for the promotion of the 
Christian vocation in the world; they are free to hold meetings to pursue these 
purposes in common&quot;(108).</P>
<P>It is a question of a freedom that is to be acknowledged and guaranteed by 
ecclesial authority and always and only to be exercised in Church communion. 
Consequently, the right of the lay faithful to form groups is essentially in 
relation to the Church's life of communion and to her mission.</P>
<P><B><I>&quot;Criteria of Ecclesiality&quot;for Lay Groups</I></B></P>
<P>30. It is always from the perspective of the Church's communion and mission, 
and not in opposition to the freedom to associate, that one understands the 
necessity of having <I>clear and definite criteria for discerning and 
recognizing </I>such lay groups, also called &quot;Criteria of Ecclesiality&quot;.</P>
<P>The following basic criteria might be helpful in evaluating an association of 
the lay faithful in the Church:</P>
<P>-<I> The primacy given to the call of every Christian to holiness, </I>as it 
is manifested &quot;in the fruits of grace which the spirit produces in the 
faithful&quot;(109) and in a growth towards the fullness of Christian life and the 
perfection of charity(110).</P>
<P>In this sense whatever association of the lay faithful there might be, it is 
always called to be more of an instrument leading to holiness in the Church, 
through fostering and promoting &quot;a more intimate unity between the everyday life 
of its members and their faith&quot;(111).</P>
<P>-<I> The responsibility of professing the Catholic faith, </I>embracing and 
proclaiming the truth about Christ, the Church and humanity, in obedience to the 
Church's Magisterium, as the Church interprets it. For this reason every 
association of the lay faithful must be a <I>forum </I>where the faith is 
proclaimed as well as taught in its total content.</P>
<P>-<I> The witness to a strong and authentic communion </I>in filial 
relationship to the Pope, in total adherence to the belief that he is the 
perpetual and visible center of unity of the universal Church(112), and with the 
local Bishop, &quot;the visible principle and foundation of unity&quot;(113) in the 
particular Church, and in &quot;mutual esteem for all forms of the Church's 
apostolate&quot;(114).</P>
<P>The communion with Pope and Bishop must be expressed in loyal readiness to 
embrace the doctrinal teachings and pastoral initiatives of both Pope and 
Bishop. Moreover, Church communion demands both an acknowledgment of a 
legitimate plurality of forms in the associations of the lay faithful in the 
Church and at the same time, a willingness to cooperate in working together.</P>
<P>-<I> Conformity to and participation in the Church's apostolic goals, </I>
that is, &quot;the evangelization and sanctification of humanity and the Christian 
formation of people's conscience, so as to enable them to infuse the spirit of 
the gospel into the various communities and spheres of life&quot;(115).</P>
<P>From this perspective, every one of the group forms of the lay faithful is 
asked to have a missionary zeal which will increase their effectiveness as 
participants in a re-evangelization.</P>
<P>-<I> A commitment to a presence in human society, </I>which in light of the 
Church's social doctrine, places it at the service of the total dignity of the 
person.</P>
<P>Therefore, associations of the lay faithful must become fruitful outlets for 
participation and solidarity in bringing about conditions that are more just and 
loving within society.</P>
<P>The fundamental criteria mentioned at this time find their verification in 
the <I>actual fruits</I> that various group forms show in their organizational 
life and the works they perform, such as: the renewed appreciation for prayer, 
contemplation, liturgical and sacramental life, the reawakening of vocations to 
Christian marriage, the ministerial priesthood and the consecrated life; a 
readiness to participate in programmes and Church activities at the local, 
national and international levels; a commitment to catechesis and a capacity for 
teaching and forming Christians; a desire to be present as Christians in various 
settings of social life and the creation and awakening of charitable, cultural 
and spiritual works; the spirit of detachment and evangelical poverty leading to 
a greater generosity in charity towards all; conversion to the Christian life or 
the return to Church communion of those baptized members who have fallen away 
from the faith.</P>
<P><B><I>The Pastors in Service to Communion</I></B></P>
<P>31. The Pastors of the Church even if faced with possible and understandable 
difficulties as a result of such associations and the process of employing new 
forms, cannot renounce the service provided by their authority, not simply for 
the well-being of the Church, but also for the well-being of the lay 
associations themselves. In this sense they ought to accompany their work of 
discernment with guidance and, above all, encouragement so that lay associations 
might grow in Church communion and mission.</P>
<P>It is exceedingly opportune that some new associations and movements receive

<I>official recognition </I>and explicit approval from competent Church 
authority to facilitate their growth on both the national and international 
level. The Council has already spoken in this regard: &quot;Depending on its various 
forms and goals, the lay apostolate provides for different types of 
relationships with the hierarchy... Certain forms of the lay apostolate are 
given explicit recognition by the hierarchy, though in different ways. Because 
of the demands of the common good of the Church, moreover, ecclesial authority 
can select and promote in a particular way some of the apostolic associations 
and projects which have an immediately spiritual purpose, thereby assuming in 
them a special responsibility&quot;(116).</P>
<P>Among the various forms of the lay apostolate which have a particular 
relationship to the hierarchy, the Synod Fathers have singled out various 
movements and associations of <I>Catholic Action </I>in which &quot;indeed, in this 
organic and stable form, the lay faithful may freely associate under the 
movement of the Holy Spirit, in communion with their bishop and priests, so that 
in a way proper to their vocation and with some special method they might be of 
service through their faithfulness and good works to promote the growth of the 
entire Christian community, pastoral activities and infusing every aspect of 
life with the gospel spirit&quot;(117).</P>
<P>The Pontifical Council for the Laity has the task of preparing a list of 
those associations which have received the official approval of the Holy See, 
and, at the same time, of drawing up, together with the Pontifical Council for 
the Union of Christians, the basic conditions on which this approval might be 
given to ecumenical associations in which there is a majority of Catholics, and 
determining those cases in which such an approval is not possible(118).</P>
<P>All of us, Pastors and lay faithful, have the duty to promote and nourish 
stronger bonds and mutual esteem, cordiality and collaboration among the various 
forms of lay associations. Only in this way can the richness of the gifts and 
charisms that the Lord oflers us bear their fruitful contribution in building 
the common house: &quot;For the sound building of a common house it is necessary, 
furthermore, that every spirit of antagonism and conflict be put aside and that 
the competition be in outdoing one another in showing honour (cf.

<I>Rom </I>12:10), in attaining a mutual affection, a will towards 
collaboration, with patience, far-sightedness, and readiness to sacrifice which 
will at times be required&quot;(119).</P>
<P>So as to render thanks to God for the great <I>gift </I>of Church communion 
which is the reflection in time of the eternal and ineffable communion of the 
love of God, Three in One, we once again consider Jesus' words: &quot;I am the vine, 
you are the branches&quot; (<I>Jn </I>15:5). The awareness of the gift ought to be 
accompanied by a strong sense of <I>responsibility </I>for its use: it is, in 
fact, a gift that, like the talent of the gospel parable, must be put to work in 
a life of ever-increasing communion.</P>
<P>To be responsible for the gift of communion means, first of all, to be 
committed to overcoming each temptation to division and opposition that works 
against the Christian life with its responsibility in the apostolate. The cry of 
Saint Paul continues to resound as a reproach to those who are &quot;wounding the 
Body of Christ&quot;: &quot;What I mean is that each one of you says, 'I belong to Paul', 
or 'I belong to Cephas', or 'I belong to Christ!' Is Christ divided?&quot; (1 <I>Cor </I>
1: 12-13). No, rather let these words of the apostle sound a persuasive call: &quot; 
I appeal to you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you 
agree and that there be no dissensions among you, but that you be united in the 
same mind and the same judgment&quot; (1 <I>Cor </I>1 :10).</P>
<P>Thus the life of Church communion will become a <I>sign </I>for all the world 
and a compelling <I>force </I>that will lead persons to faith in Christ: &quot;that 
they may all be one; even as you, Father, are in me and I in you, that they also 
may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me&quot; (<I>Tn

</I>17:21). In such a way communion leads to <I>mission, </I>and mission itself 
to communion.</P>
<CENTER>
<P>CHAPTER III</P> 
<P><B>I HAVE APPOINTED YOU TO GO FORTH AND BEAR FRUIT</B><BR><B>The 
Coresponsibility of the Lay Faithful in the Church as Mission</B></P></CENTER>
<P><B><I>Mission to Communion </I></B></P>
<P>32. We return to the biblical image of the vine and the branches, which 
immediately and quite appropriately lends itself to a consideration of 
fruitfulness and life. Engrafted to the vine and brought to life, the branches 
are expected to bear fruit: &quot;He who abides in me, and I in him, he it is that 
bears much fruit&quot; (<I>Jn </I>15:5). Bearing fruit is an essential demand of life 
in Christ and life in the Church. The person who does not bear fruit does not 
remain in communion: &quot;Each branch of mine that bears no fruit, he (my Father) 
takes away&quot; (<I>Jn </I>15: 2).</P>
<P>Communion with Jesus, which gives rise to the communion of Christians among 
themselves, is an indispensable condition for bearing fruit: &quot;Apart from me you 
can do nothing&quot; (<I>Jn </I>15:5). And communion with others is the most 
magnificent fruit that the branches can give: in fact, it is the gift of Christ 
and His Spirit.</P>
<P>At this point <I>communion begets communion: </I>essentially it is likened to 
a <I>mission on behalf of communion. </I>In fact, Jesus says to his disciples: 
&quot;You did not choose me, but I chose you and <I>appointed you that you should go 
and bear fruit </I>and that your fruit should abide&quot; (<I>Jn

</I>15:16).</P>
<P>Communion and mission are profoundly connected with each other, they 
interpenetrate and mutually imply each other, to the point that <I>communion 
represents both the source and the fruit of mission: communion gives rise to 
mission and mission is accomplished in communion. </I>It is always the one and 
the same Spirit who calls together and unifies the Church and sends her to 
preach the Gospel &quot;to the ends of the earth&quot; (<I>Acts</I> 1:8). On her part, the 
Church knows that the communion received by her as a gift is destined for all 
people. Thus the Church feels she owes to each individual and to humanity as a 
whole the gift received from the Holy Spirit that pours the charity of Jesus 
Christ into the hearts of believers, as a mystical force for internal cohesion 
and external growth. The mission of the Church flows from her own nature. Christ 
has willed it to be so: that of &quot;sign and instrument... of unity of all the 
human race&quot;(120). Such a mission has the purpose of making everyone know and 
live the &quot;new&quot; communion that the Son of God made man introduced into the 
history of the world. In this regard, then, the testimony of John the Evangelist 
defines in an undeniable way the blessed end towards which the entire mission of 
the Church is directed: &quot;That which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to 
you, so that you may have fellowship with us; and our fellowship is with the 
Father and with his Son Jesus Christ&quot; (1 <I>Jn </I>1:3).</P>
<P>In the context of Church mission, then, <I>the Lord entrusts a great part of 
the responsibility to the lay faithful, in communion with all other members of 
the People of God. </I>This fact, fully understood by the Fathers of the Second 
Vatican Council, recurred with renewed clarity and increased vigor in all the 
works of the Synod: &quot;Indeed, Pastors know how much the lay faithful contribute 
to the welfare of the entire Church. They also know that they themselves were 
not established by Christ to undertake alone the entire saving mission of the 
Church towards the world, but they understand that it is their exalted office to 
be shepherds of the lay faithful and also to recognize the latter's services and 
charisms that all according to their proper roles may cooperate in this common 
undertaking with one heart&quot;(121).</P>
<P><B><I>Proclaiming the Gospel </I></B></P>
<P>33. The lay faithful, precisely because they are members of the Church, have 
the vocation and mission of proclaiming the Gospel: they are prepared for this 
work by the sacraments of Christian initiation and by the gifts of the Holy 
Spirit.</P>
<P>In a very clear and significant passage from the Second Vatican Council we 
read: &quot;As sharers in the mission of Christ, priest, prophet and king, the lay 
faithful have an active part to play in the life and activity of the Church... 
Strengthened by their active participation in the liturgical life of their 
community, they are eager to do their share in apostolic works of that 
community. They lead to the Church people who are perhaps far removed from it; 
they earnestly cooperate in presenting the Word of God, especially by means of 
catechetical instruction; and offer their special skills to make the care of 
souls and the administration of the temporal goods of the Church more 
efficient&quot;(122).</P>
<P>The entire mission of the Church, then, is concentrated and manifested in 
<I>evangelization. </I>Through the winding passages of history the Church has 
made her way under the grace and the command of Jesus Christ: &quot;Go into all the 
world and preach the gospel to the whole creation&quot; (<I>Mk </I>16:15) &quot;... and 
lo, I am with you always, until the close of the age&quot; (<I>Mt</I> 
28:20). &quot;To evangelize&quot;, writes Paul VI, &quot;is the grace and vocation proper to 
the Church, her most profound identity&quot;(123).</P>
<P>Through evangelization the Church is built up into a <I>community of faith:

</I>more precisely, into a community that <I>confesses </I>the faith in full 
adherence to the Word of God which is <I>celebrated </I>in the Sacraments, and 
<I>lived </I>in charity, the principle of Christian moral existence. In fact, 
the &quot;good news&quot; is directed to stirring a person to a conversion of heart and 
life and a clinging to Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour; to disposing a person 
to receive Baptism and the Eucharist and to strengthen a person in the prospect 
and realization of new life according to the Spirit.</P>
<P>Certainly the command of Jesus: &quot;Go and preach the Gospel&quot; always maintains 
its vital value and its ever-pressing obligation. Nevertheless, the 
<I>present situation, </I>not only of the world but also of many parts of the 
Church, <I>absolutely demands that the word of Christ receive a more ready and 
generous obedience. </I>Every disciple is personally called by name; no disciple 
can withhold making a response: &quot;Woe to me, if I do not preach the gospel&quot; (<I>1 
Cor</I> 9:16).</P>
<P><B><I>The Hour Has Come for a Re-Evangelization</I></B></P>
<P>34. Whole countries and nations where religion and the Christian life were 
formerly flourishing and capable of fostering a viable and working community of 
faith, are now put to a hard test, and in some cases, are even undergoing a 
radical transformation, as a result of a constant spreading of an indifference 
to religion, of secularism and atheism. This particularly concerns countries and 
nations of the so-called First World, in which economic well-being and 
consumerism, even if coexistent with a tragic situation of poverty and misery, 
inspires and sustains a life lived &quot;as if God did not exist&quot;. This indifference 
to religion and the practice of religion devoid of true meaning in the face of 
life's very serious problems, are not less worrying and upsetting when compared 
with declared atheism. Sometimes the Christian faith as well, while maintaining 
some of the externals of its tradition and rituals, tends to be separated from 
those moments of human existence which have the most significance, such as, 
birth, suffering and death. In such cases, the questions and formidable enigmas 
posed by these situations, if remaining without responses, expose contemporary 
people to an inconsolable delusion or to the temptation of eliminating the truly 
humanizing dimension of life implicit in these problems.</P>
<P>On the other hand, in other regions or nations many vital traditions of piety 
and popular forms of Christian religion are still conserved; but today this 
moral and spiritual patrimony runs the risk of being dispersed under the impact 
of a multiplicity of processes, including secularization and the spread of 
sects. Only a re-evangelization can assure the growth of a clear and deep faith, 
and serve to make these traditions a force for authentic freedom.</P>
<P>Without doubt a mending of the Christian fabric of society is urgently needed 
in all parts of the world. But for this to come about what is needed is to <I>
first remake the Christian fabric of the ecclesial community itself </I>present 
in these countries and nations.</P>
<P>At this moment the lay faithful, in virtue of their participation in the 
prophetic mission of Christ, are fully part of this work of the Church. Their 
responsibility, in particular, is to testify how the Christian faith constitutes 
the only fully valid response-consciously perceived and stated by all in varying 
degrees-to the problems and hopes that life poses to every person and society. 
This will be possible if the lay faithful will know how to overcome in 
themselves the separation of the Gospel from life, to again take up in their 
daily activities in family, work and society, an integrated approach to life 
that is fully brought about by the inspiration and strength of the Gospel.</P>
<P>To all people of today I once again repeat the impassioned cry with which I 
began my pastoral ministry: <I>&quot;Do not be afraid! Open, in deed, open wide the 
doors to Christ! </I></P>
<P>Open to his saving power the confines of states, and systems political and 
economic, as well as the vast fields of culture, civilization, and development. 
Do not be afraid! Christ knows 'what is inside a person'. Only he knows! Today 
too often people do not know what they carry inside, in the deepest recesses of 
their soul, in their heart. Too often people are uncertain about a sense of life 
on earth. Invaded by doubts they are led into despair. Therefore-with humility 
and trust I beg and implore you-allow Christ to speak to the person in you. Only 
he has the words of life, yes, eternal life&quot;(124).</P>
<P>Opening wide the doors to Christ, accepting him into humanity itself poses 
absolutely no threat to persons, indeed it is the only road to take to arrive at 
the total truth and the exalted value of the human individual.</P>
<P>This vital synthesis will be achieved when the lay faithful know how to put 
the gospel and their daily duties of life into a most shining and convincing 
testimony, where, not fear but the loving pursuit of Christ and adherence to him 
will be the factors determining how a person is to live and grow, and these will 
lead to new ways of living more in conformity with human dignity.</P>
<P><I>Humanity is loved by God! </I>This very simple yet profound proclamation 
is owed to humanity by the Church. Each Christian's words and life must make 
this proclamation resound: God loves you, Christ came for you, Christ is for you 
&quot;the Way, the Truth and the Life!&quot; (<I>Jn</I> 14:6).</P>
<P>This re-evangelization is directed not only to individual persons but also to 
entire portions of populations in the variety of their situations, surroundings 
and cultures. Its purpose is the <I>formation of mature ecclesial communities, </I>
in which the faith might radiate and fulfill the basic meaning of adherence to 
the person of Christ and his Gospel, of an encounter and sacramental communion 
with him, and of an existence lived in charity and in service.</P>
<P>The lay faithful have their part to fulfill in the formation of these 
ecclesial communities, not only through an active and responsible participation 
in the life of the community, in other words, through a testimony that only they 
can give, but also through a missionary zeal and activity towards the many 
people who still do not believe and who no longer live the faith received at 
Baptism.</P>
<P>In the case of coming generations, the lay faithful must offer the very 
valuable contribution, more necessary than ever, of a <I>systematic work in 
catechesis. </I>The Synod Fathers have gratefully taken note of the work of 
catechists, acknowledging that they &quot;have a task that carries great importance 
in animating ecclesial communities&quot;(125). It goes without saying that Christian 
parents are the primary and irreplaceable catechists of their children, a task 
for which they are given the grace by the Sacrament of Matrimony. At the same 
time, however, we all ought to be aware of the &quot;rights&quot; that each baptized 
person has to being instructed, educated and supported in the faith and the 
Christian life.</P>
<P><B><I>Go Into the Whole World</I></B></P>
<P>35. While pointing out and experiencing the present urgency for a 
re-evangelization, the Church cannot withdraw from <I>her ongoing mission </I><I>
of

</I><I>bringing the gospel to the multitudes </I>-the millions and millions of 
men and women-<I>who as yet do not know Christ the Redeemer </I><I>of </I><I>
humanity.

</I>In a specific way this is the missionary work that Jesus entrusted and again 
entrusts each day to his Church.</P>
<P>The activity of the lay faithful, who are always present in these 
surroundings, is revealed in these days as increasingly necessary and valuable. 
As it stands, the command of the Lord &quot;Go into the whole world&quot; is continuing to 
find a generous response from laypersons who are ready to leave familiar 
surroundings, their work, their region or country, at least for a determined 
time, to go into mission territory. Even Christian married couples, in imitation 
of Aquila and Priscilla (cf. <I>Acts </I>18; Rom 16:3 ff), are offering a 
comforting testimony of impassioned love for Christ and the Church through their 
valuable presence in mission lands. A true missionary presence is exercised even 
by those who for various reasons live in countries or surroundings where the 
Church is not yet established and bear witness to the faith.</P>
<P>However, at present the missionary concern is taking on such extensive and 
serious proportions for the Church that only a truly consolidated effort to 
assume responsibility by all members of the Church, both individuals and 
communities, can lead to the hope for a more fruitful response.</P>
<P>The invitation addressed by the Second Vatican Council to the particular 
Church retains all its value, even demanding at present a more extensive and 
more decisive acceptance: &quot;Since the particular Churches are bound to mirror the 
universal Church as perfectly as possible, let them be fully aware that they 
have been sent also to those who do not believe in Christ&quot;(126).</P>
<P>The Church today ought to take <I>a giant step forward </I>in her 
evangelization effort, and enter into <I>a new stage of history </I>in her 
missionary dynamism. In a world where the lessening of distance makes the world 
increasingly smaller, the Church community ought to strengthen the bonds among 
its members, exchange vital energies and means, and commit itself as a group to 
a unique and common mission of proclaiming and living the Gospel. &quot;So-called 
younger Churches have need of the strength of the older Churches and the older 
ones need the witness and impulse of the younger, so that individual Churches 
receive the riches of other Churches&quot;(127).</P>
<P>In this area, younger Churches are finding that an essential and undeniable 
element in the <I>founding of Churches</I>(128) is the formation not only of 
local clergy but also of a mature and responsible lay faithful: in this way the 
community which itself has been evangelized goes forth into a new region of the 
world so that it too might respond to the mission of proclaiming and bearing 
witness to the Gospel of Christ.</P>
<P>The Synod Fathers have mentioned that the lay faithful can favour the 
relations which ought to be established with followers of <I>various religions 
</I>through their example in the situations in which they live and in their 
activities: &quot;Throughout the world today the Church lives among people of various 
religions... All the Faithful, especially the lay faithful who live among the 
people of other religions, whether living in their native region or in lands as 
migrants, ought to be for all a sign of the Lord and his Church, in a way 
adapted to the actual living situation of each place. Dialogue among religions 
has a preeminent part, for it leads to love and mutual respect, and takes away, 
or at least diminishes, prejudices among the followers of various religions and 
promotes unity and friendship among peoples&quot;(129).</P>
<P>What is first needed for the evangelization of the world are <I>those who 
will evangelize. </I>In this regard everyone, beginning with the Christian 
family, must feel the responsibility to foster the birth and growth of <I>
vocations,

</I>both priestly and religious as well as in the lay state, <I>specifically 
directed to the missions. </I>This should be done by relying on every 
appropriate means, but without ever neglecting the privileged means of prayer, 
according to the very words of the Lord Jesus: &quot;The harvest is plentiful, but 
the labourers are few; pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out 
labourers into his harvest!&quot; (<I>Mt</I> 9:37, 38).</P>
<P><B><I>To Live the Gospel Serving the Person and Society</I></B> </P>
<P>36. In both accepting and proclaiming the Gospel in the power of the Spirit 
the Church becomes at one and the same time an &quot;evangelizing and evangelized&quot; 
community, and for this very reason she is made the <I>servant of all. </I>In 
her the lay faithful participate in the mission of service to the person and 
society. Without doubt the Church has the Kingdom of God as her supreme goal, of 
which &quot;she on earth is its seed and beginning&quot;(130), and is therefore totally 
consecrated to the glorification of the Father. However, the Kingdom is the 
source of full liberation and total salvation for all people: with this in mind, 
then, the Church walks and lives, intimately bound in a real sense to their 
history.</P>
<P>Having received the responsibility of manifesting to the world the mystery of 
God that shines forth in Jesus Christ, <I>the Church likewise awakens one person 
to another, </I>giving a sense of one's existence, opening each to the whole 
truth about the individual and of each person's final destiny(131). From this 
perspective the Church is called, in virtue of her very mission of 
evangelization, to serve all humanity. Such service is rooted primarily in the 
extraordinary and profound fact that &quot;through the Incarnation the Son of God has 
united himself in some fashion to every person&quot;(132).</P>
<P>For this reason the person &quot;is the primary route that the Church must travel 
in fulfilling her mission: the individual is the <I>primary and fundamental way 
for the Church, </I>the way traced out by Christ himself, the way that leads in 
variably through the mystery of the Incarnation and Redemption&quot;(133).</P>
<P>The Second Vatican Council, repeatedly and with a singular clarity and force, 
expressed these very sentiments in its documents. We again read a particularly 
enlightening text from the Constitution <I>Gaudium et Spes: </I>&quot;Pursuing the 
saving purpose which is proper to her, the Church not only communicates divine 
life to all, but in some way casts the reflected light of that divine life over 
the entire earth. She does this most of all by her healing and elevating impact 
on the dignity of the human person, by the way in which she strengthens the 
bonds of human society, and imbues the daily activity of people with a deeper 
sense and meaning. Thus, through her individual members and the whole community, 
the Church believes she cn contribute much to make the family of man and its 
history more human&quot;(134).</P>
<P>In this work of contributing to the human family, for which the whole Church 
is responsible, a particular place falls to the lay faithful, by reason of their 
&quot;secular character&quot;, obliging them, in their proper and irreplaceable way, to 
work towards the Christian animation of the temporal order.</P>
<P><B><I>Promoting the Dignity of the Person</I></B></P>
<P>37.<I> To rediscover and make others rediscover the inviolable dignity of 
every human person </I>makes up an essential task, in a certain sense, the 
central and unifying task of the service which the Church, and the lay faithful 
in her, are called to render to the human family.</P>
<P>Among all other earthly beings, <I>only a man or a woman is a &quot;person&quot;, a 
conscious and free being </I>and, precisely for this reason, the &quot;center and 
summit&quot; of all that exists on the earth(135).</P>
<P>The dignity of the person is <I>the most precious possession </I>of an 
individual. As a result, the value of one person transcends all the material 
world. The words of Jesus, &quot;For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole 
world and to forfeit his life?&quot; (<I>Mk</I> 8:36)<I> </I>contain an enlightening 
and stirring statement about the individual: value comes not from what a person 
&quot;has&quot; even if the person possessed the whole world!-as much as from what a 
person &quot;is&quot;: the goods of the world do not count as much as the good of the 
person, the good which is the person individually.</P>
<P>The dignity of the person is manifested in all its radiance when the person's 
origin and destiny are considered: created by God in his image and likeness as 
well as redeemed by the most precious blood of Christ, the person is called to 
be a &quot;child in the Son&quot; and a living temple of the Spirit, destined for the 
eternal life of blessed communion with God. For this reason every violation of 
the personal dignity of the human being cries out in vengeance to God and is an 
offence against the Creator of the individual.</P>
<P>In virtue of a personal dignity the human being is <I>always a value as an 
individual, </I>and as such demands being considered and treated as a person and 
never, on the contrary, considered and treated as an object to be used, or as a 
means, or as a thing.</P>
<P>The dignity of the person constitutes <I>the foundation of the equality of 
all people among themselves. </I>As a result all forms of discrimination are 
totally unacceptable, especially those forms which unfortunately continue to 
divide and degrade the human family, from those based on race or economics to 
those social and cultural, from political to geographic, etc. Each 
discrimination constitutes an absolutely intolerable injustice, not so much for 
the tensions and the conflicts that can be generated in the social sphere, as 
much as for the dishonour inflicted on the dignity of the person: not only to 
the dignity of the individual who is the victim of the injustice, but still more 
to the one who commits the injustice.</P>
<P>Just as personal dignity is the foundation of equality of all people among 
themselves, so it is also <I>the foundation of participation and solidarity of 
all people among themselves: </I>dialogue and communion are rooted ultimately in 
what people &quot;are&quot;, first and foremost, rather than on what people &quot;have&quot;.</P>
<P>The dignity of the person is the indestructible property of <I>every human 
being. </I>The force of this affirmation is based on the <I>uniqueness and 
irrepeatibility of every person. </I>From it flows that the individual can never 
be reduced by all that seeks to crush and to annihilate the person into the 
anonymity that comes from collectivity, institutions, structures and systems. As 
an individual, a person is not a number or simply a link in a chain, nor even 
less, an impersonal element in some system. The most radical and elevating 
affirmation of the value of every human being was made by the Son of God in his 
becoming man in the womb of a woman, as we continue to be reminded each 
Christmas(136).</P>
<P><B><I>Respecting the Inviolable Right to Life</I></B></P>
<P>38. In effect the acknowledgment of the personal dignity of every human being 
demands <I>the respect, the defence and the promotion of the</I><I>rights of the 
human person. </I>It is a question of inherent, universal and inviolable rights. 
No one, no individual, no group, no authority, no State, can change-let alone 
eliminate-them because such rights find their source in God himself.</P>
<P>The inviolability of the person which is a reflection of the absolute 
inviolability of God, fnds its primary and fundamental expression in the

<I>inviolability of human life. </I>Above all, the common outcry, which is 
justly made on behalf of human rights-for example, the right to health, to home, 
to work, to family, to culture- is false and illusory if <I>the right to life,

</I>the most basic and fundamental right and the condition for all other 
personal rights, is not defended with maximum determination.</P>
<P>The Church has never yielded in the face of all the violations that the right 
to life of every human being has received, and continues to receive, both from 
individuals and from those in authority. The human being is entitled to such 
rights, <I>in every phase of development, </I>from conception until natural 
death; and in <I>every condition, </I>whether healthy or sick, whole or 
handicapped, rich or poor. The Second Vatican Council openly proclaimed: &quot;All 
offences against life itself, such as every kind of murder, genocide, abortion, 
euthanasia and willful suicide; all violations of the integrity of the human 
person, such as mutilation, physical and mental torture, undue psychological 
pressures; all offences against human dignity, such as subhuman living 
conditions, arbitrary imprisonment, deportation, slavery, prostitution, the 
selling of women and children, degrading working conditions where men are 
treated as mere tools for profit rather than free and responsible persons; all 
these and the like are certainly criminal: they poison human society; and they 
do more harm to those who practice them than those who suffer from the injury. 
Moreover, they are a supreme dishonour to the Creator&quot;(137).</P>
<P>If, indeed, everyone has the mission and responsibility of acknowledging the 
personal dignity of every human being and of defending the right to life, some 
lay faithful are given a particular title to this task: such as <I>parents, 
teachers, healthworkers and the many who hold economic and political power.</I></P>
<P>The Church today lives a fundamental aspect of her mission in lovingly and 
generously accepting every human being, especially those who are weak and sick. 
This is made all the more necessary as a &quot;culture of death&quot; threatens to take 
control. In fact, &quot;the Church family believes that human life, even if weak and 
suffering, is always a wonderful gift of God's goodness. Against the pessimism 
and selfishness which casts a shadow over the world, the Church stands for life: 
in each human life she sees the splendour of that 'Yes', that 'Amen', which is 
Christ himself (cf. 2 <I>Cor </I>1:19; <I>Rev </I>3:14). To the 'No' which 
assails and afflicts the world, she replies with this living 'Yes', this 
defending of the human person and the world from all who plot against 
life&quot;(138). It is the responsibility of the lay faithful, who more directly 
through their vocation or their profession are involved in accepting life, to 
make the Church's &quot;Yes&quot; to human life concrete and efficacious.</P>
<P>The enormous development of <I>biological and medical science, </I>united to 
an amazing <I>power in technology, </I>today provides possibilities on the very 
frontier of human life which imply new responsibilities. In fact, today humanity 
is in the position not only of &quot;observing&quot; but even &quot;exercising a control over&quot; 
human life at its very beginning and in its first stages of development.</P>
<P>The <I>moral conscience </I>of humanity is not able to turn aside or remain 
indifferent in the face of these gigantic strides accomplished by a technology 
that is acquiring a continually more extensive and profound dominion over the 
working processes that govern procreation and the first phases of human life. 
Today as perhaps never before in history or in this field, <I>wisdom shows 
itselt to be the only firm basis to salvation, </I>in that persons engaged in 
scientific research and in its application are always to act with intelligence 
and love, that is, respecting, even remaining in veneration of, the inviolable 
dignity of the personhood of every human being, from the first moment of life's 
existence. This occurs when science and technology are committed with licit 
means to the defence of life and the cure of disease in its beginnings, refusing 
on the contrary-even for the dignity of research itself-to perform operations 
that result in falsifying the genetic patrimony of the individual and of human 
generative power(139).</P>
<P>The lay faithful, having responsibility in various capacities and at 
different levels of science as well as in the medical, social, legislative and 
economic fields must <I>courageously accept the &quot;challenge&quot; posed by new 
problems in bioethics. </I>The Synod Fathers used these words: &quot;Christians ought 
to exercise their responsibilities as masters of science and technology, and not 
become their slaves ... In view of the moral challenges presented by enormous 
new technological power, endangering not only fundamental human rights but the 
very biological essence of the human species, it is of utmost importance that 
lay Christians with the help of the universal Church-take up the task of calling 
culture back to the principles of an authentic humanism, giving a dynamic and 
sure foundation to the promotion and defence of the rights of the human being in 
one's very essence, an essence which the preaching of the Gospel reveals to 
all(140).</P>
<P>Today maximum vigilance must be exercised by everyone in the face of the 
phenomenon of the concentration of power and technology. In fact such a 
concentration has a tendency to manipulate not only the biological essence but 
the very content of people's consciences and life styles, thereby worsening the 
condition of entire peoples by discrimination and marginization.</P>
<P><B><I>Free to Call Upon the Name of the Lord</I></B></P>
<P>39. Respect for the dignity of the person, which implies the defence and 
promotion of human rights, demands the recognition of the religious dimension of 
the individual. This is not simply a requirement &quot;concerning matters of faith&quot;, 
but a requirement that finds itself inextricably bound up with the very reality 
of the individual. In fact, the individual's relation to God is a constitutive 
element of the very &quot;being&quot; and &quot;existence&quot; of an individual: it is in God that 
we &quot;live, move and have our being&quot; 
<I>(Acts </I>17:28). Even if not all believe this truth, the many who are 
convinced of it have the right to be respected for their faith and for their 
life-choice, individual and communal, that flows from that faith. This is the 
<I>right of freedom of conscience and religious freedom, </I>the effective 
acknowledgment of which is among the highest goods and the most serious duties 
of every people that truly wishes to assure the good of the person and society. 
&quot;Religious freedom, an essential requirement of the dignity of every person, is 
a cornerstone of the structure of human rights, and for this reason an 
irreplaceable factor in the good of individuals and of the whole of society, as 
well as of the personal fulfilment of each individual. It follows that the 
freedom of individuals and of communities to profess and practice their religion 
is an essential element for peaceful human coexistence ... The civil and social 
right to religious freedom, inasmuch as it touches the most intimate sphere of 
the spirit, is a point of reference for the other fundamental rights and in some 
way becomes a measure of them&quot;(141).</P>
<P>The Synod did not forget the many brothers and sisters that still do not 
enjoy such a right and have to face difficulties, marginization, suffering, 
persecution, and oftentimes death because of professing the faith. For the most 
part, they are brothers and sisters of the Christian lay faithful. The 
proclamation of the Gospel and the Christian testimony given in a life of 
suffering and martyrdom make up the summit of the apostolic life among Christ's 
disciples, just as the love for the Lord Jesus even to the giving of one's life 
constitutes a source of extraordinary fruitfulness for the building up of the 
Church. Thus the mystic vine bears witness to its earnestness in the faith, as 
expressed by Saint Augustine: &quot;But that vine, as predicted by the prophets and 
even by the Lord himself, spread its fruitful branches in the world, and becomes 
the more fruitful the more it is watered by the blood of martyrs&quot;(142).</P>
<P>The whole Church is profoundly grateful for this example and this gift. These 
sons and daughters give reason for renewing the pursuit of a holy and apostolic 
life. In this sense the Fathers at the Synod have made it their special duty &quot;to 
give thanks to those lay people who, despite their restricted liberty, live as 
tireless witnesses of faith in faithful union with the Apostolic See, although 
they may be deprived of sacred ministers. They risk everything, even life. In 
this way the lay faithful bear witness to an essential property of the Church: 
God's Church is born of God's grace, which is expressed in an excellent way in 
martyrdom&quot;(143).</P>
<P>Without doubt, all that has been said until now on the subject of respect for 
personal dignity and the acknowledgment of human rights concerns the 
responsibility of each Christian, of each person. However, we must immediately 
recognize how such a problem today has a <I>world dimension: </I>in fact, it is 
a question which at this moment affects entire groups, indeed entire peoples, 
who are violently being denied their basic rights. Those forms of unequal 
development among the so-called different &quot;Worlds&quot; were openly denounced in the 
recent Encyclical <I>Sollicitudo Rei Socialis.</I></P>
<P>Respect for the human person goes beyond the demands of individual morality. 
Instead, it is a basic criterion, an essential element, in the very structure of 
society, since the purpose of the whole of socety itself is geared to the human 
person.</P>
<P>Thus, intimately connected with the responsibility of <I>service to the 
person, is </I>the responsibility to <I>serve society, </I>as the general task 
of that Christian animation of the temporal order to which the lay faithful are 
called as their proper and specific role.</P>
<P><B><I>The Family: Where the Duty to Society Begins</I></B></P>
<P>40. The human person has an inherent social dimension which calls a person 
from the innermost depths of self to <I>communion </I>with others and to the 
<I>giving </I>of self to others: &quot;God, who has fatherly concern for everyone has 
willed that all people should form one family and treat one another in a spirit 
of brotherhood&quot;(144). Thus <I>society </I>as a fruit and sign of the <I>social 
nature </I>of the individual reveals its whole truth in being a 
<I>community of persons.</I></P>
<P>Thus the result is an interdependence and reciprocity between the person and 
society: all that is accomplished in favour of the person is also a service 
rendered to society, and all that is done in favour of society redounds to the 
benefit of the person. For this reason the duty of the lay faithful in the 
apostolate of the temporal order is always to be viewed both from its meaning of 
service to the person founded on the individual's uniqueness and irrepeatibility 
as well as on the meaning of service to all people which is inseparable from it.</P>
<P>The first and basic expression of the social dimension of the person, then, 
is <I>the married couple and the family: </I>&quot;But God did not create man a 
solitary being. From the beginning 'male and female he created them' <I>(Gen 
</I>1:27).<I> </I>This partnership of man and woman constitutes the first form 
of communion between persons&quot;(145). Jesus is concerned to restore integral 
dignity to the married couple and solidity to the family <I>(Mt </I>19:3-9).<I></I>Saint 
Paul shows the deep rapport between marriage and the mystery of Christ and the 
Church (cf. <I>Eph </I>5:22-6:4; <I>Col</I> 3:18-21; <I>1 Pt </I>3:1-7).</P>
<P>The <I>lay faithful's duty to society primarily begins </I>in marriage and in 
the family. This duty can only be fulfilled adequately with the conviction of 
the unique and irreplaceable value that the family has in the development of 
society and the Church herself.</P>
<P>The family is the basic cell of society. It is the cradle of life and love, 
the place in which the individual &quot;is born&quot; and &quot;grows&quot;. Therefore a primary 
concern is reserved for this community, especially, in those times when human 
egoism, the anti-birth campaign, totalitarian politics, situations of poverty, 
material, cultural and moral misery, threaten to make these very springs of life 
dry up. Furthermore, ideologies and various systems, together with forms of 
uninterest and indifference, dare to take over the role in education proper to 
the family.</P>
<P>Required in the face of this is a vast, extensive and systematic work, 
sustained not only by culture but also by economic and legislative means, which 
will safeguard the role of family in its task of being the <I>primary place of 
&quot;humanization&quot;

</I>for the person and society.</P>
<P>It is above all the lay faithful's duty in the apostolate to make the family 
aware of its identity as the primary social nucleus, and its basic role in 
society, so that it might itself become always a more <I>active and responsible 
place </I>for proper growth and proper participation in social life. In such a 
way the family can and must require from all, beginning with public authority, 
the respect for those rights which in saving the family, will save society 
itself.</P>
<P>All that is written in the Exhortation <I>Familiaris Consortio </I>about 
participation in the development of society(146) and all that the Holy See, at 
the invitation of the 1980 Synod of Bishops, has formulated with the &quot;Charter of 
Rights for the Family&quot;, represent a complete and coordinated working programme 
for all those members of the lay faithful who, in various capacities, are 
interested in the values and the needs of the family. Such a programme needs to 
be more opportunely and decisively realized as the threats to the stability and 
fruitfulness of the family become more serious and the attempt to reduce the 
value of the family and to lessen its social value become more pressing and 
coordinated.</P>
<P>As experience testifies, whole civilizations and the cohesiveness of peoples 
depend above all on the human quality of their families. For this reason the 
duty in the apostolate towards the family acquires an incomparable social value. 
The Church, for her part, is deeply convinced of it, knowing well that &quot;the path 
to the future passes through the family&quot;(147)</P>
<P><B><I>Charity: The Soul and Sustenance of Solidarity</I></B></P>
<P>41. Service to society is expressed and realized in the most diverse ways, 
from those spontaneous and informal to those more structured, from help given to 
individuals to those destined for various groups and communities of persons.</P>
<P>The whole Church as such, is directly called to the service of charity: &quot;In 
the very early days the Church added the <I>agape </I>to the Eucharistic Supper, 
and thus showed herself to be wholly united around Christ by the bond of 
charity. So too, in all ages, she is recognized by this sign of love, and while 
she rejoices in the undertakings of others, she claims works of charity as her 
own inalienable duty and right. For this reason, mercy to the poor and the sick, 
works of charity and mutual aid intended to relieve human needs of every kind, 
are held in special honour in the Church&quot;(148). <I>Charity towards one's 
neighbor, </I>through contemporary forms of the traditional spiritual and 
corporal works of mercy, represent the most immediate, ordinary and habitual 
ways that lead to the Christian animation of the temporal order, the specific 
duty of the lay faithful.</P>
<P>Through charity towards one's neighbor, the lay faithful exercise and 
manifest their participation in the kingship of Christ, that is, in the power of 
the Son of man who &quot;came not to be served but to serve&quot; <I>(Mk </I>10:45). They 
live and manifest such a kingship in a most simple yet exalted manner, possible 
for everyone at all times because charity is the highest gift offered by the 
Spirit for building up the Church (cf. 1 <I>Cor </I>13:13) and for the good of 
humanity. In fact, <I>charity gives life and sustains the works of solidarity 
that look to the total needs of the human being.</I></P>
<P>The same charity, realized not only by individuals but also in a joint way by 
groups and communities, is and will always be necessary. Nothing and no one will 
be able to substitute for it, not even the multiplicity of institutions and 
public initiatives forced to give a response to the needs-oftentimes today so 
serious and widespread-of entire populations. Paradoxically such charity is made 
increasingly necessary the more that institutions become complex in their 
organization and pretend to manage every area at hand. In the end such projects 
lose their effectiveness as a result of an impersonal functionalism, an 
overgrown bureaucracy, unjust private interests and an all-too-easy and 
generalized disengagement from a sense of duty.</P>
<P>Precisely in this context various forms of <I>volunteer work </I>which 
express themselves in a multiplicity of services and activities continue to come 
about and to spread, particularly in organized society. If this impartial 
service be truly given for the good of all persons, especially the most in need 
and forgotten by the social services of society itself, then, volunteer work can 
be considered an important expression of the apostolate, in which lay men and 
women have a primary role.</P>
<P><B><I>Public Life: for Everyone and by Everyone</I></B></P>
<P>42. A charity that loves and serves the person is never able to be separated 
from <I>justice. </I>Each in its own way demands the full, effective 
acknowledgment of the rights of the individual, to which society is ordered in 
all its structures and institutions(149).</P>
<P>In order to achieve their task directed to the Christian animation of the 
temporal order, in the sense of serving persons and society, the lay faithful 
<I>are never to relinquish their participation in &quot;public life&quot;, </I>that is, in 
the many different economic, social, legislative, administrative and cultural 
areas, which are intended to promote organically and institutionally the <I>
common good. </I>The Synod Fathers have repeatedly affirmed that every person 
has a right and duty to participate in public life, albeit in a diversity and 
complementarity of forms, levels, tasks and responsibilities. Charges of 
careerism, idolatry of power, egoism and corruption that are oftentimes directed 
at persons in government, parliaments, the ruling classes, or political parties, 
as well as the common opinion that participating in politics is an absolute 
moral danger, does not in the least justify either skepticism or an absence on 
the part of Christians in public life.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the Second Vatican Council's words are particularly 
significant: &quot;The Ckurch regards as worthy of praise and consideration the work 
of those who, as a service to others, dedicate themselves to the public good of 
the state and undertake the burdens of this task&quot;(150).</P>
<P>Public life on behalf of the person and society finds its <I>basic standard

</I>in <I>the pursuit of the common good, </I>as the good of <I>everyone </I>and 
as the good of each person taken as a <I>whole, </I>which is guaranteed and 
offered in a fitting manner to people, both as individuals and in groups, for 
their free and responsible acceptance. &quot;The political community&quot;-we read in the 
Constitution <I>Gaudium et Spes-&quot;exists </I>for that common good in which the 
community finds its full justification and meaning, and from which it derives 
its basic, proper and lawful arrangement. The common good embraces the sum total 
of all those conditions of social life by which individuals, families, and 
organizations can achieve more thoroughly their own fulfilment&quot;(151). 
Furthermore, public life on behalf of the person and society finds its <I>
continuous line of action </I>in <I>the defence and the promotion of justice, </I>
understood to be a &quot;virtue&quot;, an understanding which requires education, as well 
as a moral &quot;force&quot; that sustains the obligation to foster the rights and duties 
of each and everyone, based on the personal dignity of each human being.</P>
<P><I>The spirit of service is </I>a fundamental element in the exercise of 
political power. This spirit of service, together with the necessary competence 
and efficiency, can make &quot;virtuous&quot; or &quot;above criticism&quot; the activity of persons 
in public life which is justly demanded by the rest of the people. To accomplish 
this requires a fullscale battle and a determination to overcome every 
temptation, such as the recourse to disloyalty and to falsehood, the waste of 
public funds for the advantage of a few and those with special interests, and 
the use of ambiguous and illicit means for acquiring, maintaining and increasing 
power at any cost.</P>
<P>The lay faithful given a charge in public life certainly ought to respect the 
autonomy of earthly realities properly understood, as we read in the 
Constitution <I>Gaudium et Spes: </I>&quot;It is of great importance, especially in a 
pluralistic society, to work out a proper vision of the relationship between the 
political community and the Church, and to distinguish clearly between the 
activities of Christians, acting individually or collectively, in their own name 
as citizens guided by the dictates of a Christian conscience, and their activity 
in communion with their Pastors in the name of the Church. The Church by reason 
of her role and competence, is not identified with any political community nor 
bound by ties to any political system. She is at once the sign and the safeguard 
of the transcendental dimension of the human person&quot;(152).At the same time-and 
this is felt today as a pressing responsibility-the lay faithful must bear 
witness to those human and gospel values that are intimately connected with 
political activity itself, such as liberty and justice, solidarity, faithful and 
unselfish dedication for the good of all, a simple life-style, and a 
preferential love for the poor and the least. This demands that the lay faithful 
always be more animated by a real participation in the life of the Church and 
enlightened by her social doctrine. In this they can be supported and helped by 
the nearness of the Christian community and their Pastors(153).</P>
<P>The manner and means for achieving a public life which has true human 
development as its goal is <I>solidarity. </I>This concerns the active and 
responsible <I>participation </I>of all in public life, from individual citizens 
to various groups, from labour unions to political parties. All of us, each and 
everyone, are the goal of public life as well as its leading participants. In 
this environment, as I wrote in the Encyclical <I>Sollicitudo Rei Socialis, </I>
solidarity &quot;is not a feeling of vague compassion or shallow distress at the 
misfortunes of so many people, both near and far. On the contrary, it is <I>a 
firm and persevering determination </I>to commit oneself to the <I>common good, </I>
that is to say, to the good of all and of each individual because <I>we are all 
really responsible for all&quot;</I>(154).</P>
<P>Today political solidarity requires going beyond single nations or a single 
block of nations, to a consideration on a properly continental and world level.</P>
<P>The fruit of sound political activity, which is so much desired by everyone 
but always lacking in advancement, is <I>peace. </I>The lay faithful cannot 
remain indifferent or be strangers and inactive in the face of all that denies 
and compromises peace, namely, violence and war, torture and terrorism, 
concentration camps, militarization of public life, the arms race, and the 
nuclear threat. On the contrary, as disciples of Jesus Christ, &quot;Prince of Peace&quot; 
(<I>Is</I> 9:5)<I> </I>and &quot;Our Peace&quot; (Eph 2:14), the lay faithful ought to 
take upon themselves the task of being &quot;peacemakers&quot; (<I>Mt</I> 5:9),<I> </I>
both through a conversion of &quot;heart&quot;, justice and charity, all of which are the 
undeniable foundation of peace(155).</P>
<P>The lay faithful in working together with all those that truly seek peace and 
themselves serving in specific organizations as well as national and 
international institutions, ought to promote an extensive work of education 
intended to defeat the ruling culture of egoism, hate, the vendetta and 
hostility, and thereby to develop the culture of solidarity at every level. Such 
solidarity, in fact, &quot;is <I>the way to peace and at the same time to 
development&quot;</I>(156).From this perspective the Synod Fathers have invited 
Christians to reject as unacceptable all forms of violence, to promote attitudes 
of dialogue and peace and to commit themselves to establish a just international 
and social order(157).</P>
<P><B><I>Placing the Individual at the Center of Socio-Economic Life</I></B></P>
<P>43. Service to society on the part of the lay faithful finds its essence in 
the <I>socio-economic question, </I>which depends on the organization of <I>
work.</I></P>
<P>Recently recalled in the Encyclical <I>Sollicitudo Rei Socialis, </I>is the 
seriousness of present problems as they relate to the subject of development and 
a proposed solution according to the social doctrine of the Church. I warmly 
desire to again refer its contents to all, in particular, to the lay faithful.</P>
<P>The basis for the social doctrine of the Church is the principle of <I>the 
universal destination of goods.</I> According to the plan of God the goods of 
the earth are offered to all people and to each individual as a means towards 
the development of a truly human life. At the service of this destination of 
goods is <I>private property, </I>which -precisely for this purpose-possesses an <I>
intrinsic social function. </I>Concretely the <I>work 
</I>of man and woman represents the most common and most immediate instrument 
for the development of economic life, an instrument that constitutes at one and 
the same time a right and a duty for every individual.</P>
<P>Once again, all of this comes to mind in a particular way in the mission of 
the lay faithful. The Second Vatican Council formulates in general terms the 
purpose and criterion of their presence and their action: &quot;In the socio-economic 
realm the dignity and total vocation of the human person must be honoured and 
advanced along with the welfare of society as a whole, for man is the source, 
the center, and the purpose of all socio-economic life&quot;(158).</P>
<P>In the context of the tranformations taking place in the world of economy and 
work which are a cause of concern, the lay faithful have the responsibility of 
being in the forefront in working out a solution to the very serious problems of 
growing unemployment; to fight for the most opportune overcoming of numerous 
injustices that come from organizations of work which lack a proper goal; to 
make the workplace become a community of persons respected in their uniqueness 
and in their right to participation; to develop new solidarity among those that 
participate in a common work; to raise up new forms of entrepreneurship and to 
look again at systems of commerce, finance and exchange of technology.</P>
<P>To such an end the lay faithful must accomplish their work with professional 
competence, with human honesty, and with a Christian spirit, and especially as a 
way of their own sanctification(159), according to the explicit invitation of 
the Council: &quot;By work an individual ordinarily provides for self and family, is 
joined in fellowship to others, and renders them service; and is enabled to 
exercise genuine charity and be a partner in the work of bringing divine 
creation to perfection. Moreover, we know that through work offered to God an 
individual is associated with the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, whose labour 
with his hands at Nazareth greatly ennobled the dignity of work&quot;(160).</P>
<P>Today in an ever-increasingly acute way, the <I>so-called &quot;ecological&quot; 
question </I>poses itself in relation to socio-economic life and work Certainly 
humanity has received from God himself the task of &quot;dominating&quot; the created 
world and &quot;cultivating the garden&quot; of the world. But this is a task that 
humanity must carry out in respect for the divine image received, and, 
therefore, with intelligence and with love, assuming responsibility for the 
gifts that God has bestowed and continues to bestow. Humanity has in its 
possession a gift that must be passed on to future generations, if possible, 
passed on in better condition. Even these future generations are the recipients 
of the Lord's gifts: &quot;The dominion granted to humanity by the Creator is not an 
absolute power, nor can one speak of a freedom to 'use and misuse', or to 
dispose of things as one pleases. The limitation imposed from the beginning by 
the Creator himself and expressed symbolically by the prohibition not to 'eat of 
the fruit of the tree' (cf. <I>Gen </I>2:16-17) shows clearly enough that, when 
it comes to the natural world, we are subject not only to biological laws but 
also to moral ones, which cannot be violated with impunity. A true concept of 
development cannot ignore the use of the things of nature, the renewability of 
resources and the consequences of haphazard industrialization-three 
considerations which alert our consciences to the <I>moral dimension </I>of 
development&quot;(161).</P>
<P><B><I>Evangelizing Culture and the Cultures of Humanity</I></B></P>
<P>44. Service to the individual and to human society is expressed and finds its 
fulfilment through <I>the creation and the transmission of culture, </I>which 
especially in our time constitutes one of the more serious tasks of living 
together as a human family and of social evolution. In light of the Council, we 
mean by &quot;culture&quot; all those &quot;factors which go to the refining and developing of 
humanity's diverse spiritual and physical endowments. It means the efforts of 
the human family to bring the world under its control through its knowledge and 
its labour; to humanize social life both in the family and in the whole civic 
community through the improvement of customs and institutions; to express 
through its works the great spiritual experiences and aspirations of all peoples 
throughout the ages; finally, to communicate and to preserve them to be an 
inspiration for the progress of many, indeed of the whole human race&quot;(162). In 
this sense, culture must be held as the common good of every people, the 
expression of its dignity, liberty and creativity, and the testimony of its 
course through history. In particular, only from within and through culture does 
the Christian faith become a part of history and the creator of history.</P>
<P>The Church is fully aware of a pastoral urgency that calls for an absolutely 
special concern for culture in those circumstances where the development of a 
culture becomes disassociated not only from Christian faith but even from human 
values(163), as well as in those situations where science and technology are 
powerless in giving an adequate response to the pressing questions of truth and 
well-being that burn in people's hearts. For this reason the Church calls upon 
the lay faithful to be present, as signs of courage and intellectual creativity, 
in the privileged places of culture, that is, the world of education-school and 
university-in places of scientific and technological research, the areas of 
artistic creativity and work in the humanities. Such a presence is destined not 
only for the recognition and possible purification of the elements that 
critically burden existing culture, but also for the elevation of these cultures 
through the riches which have their source in the Gospel and the Christian 
faith. The extensive treatment by the Second Vatican Council of the rapport 
between the Gospel and culture represents a constant historic fact and at the 
same time serves as a working ideal of particular and immediate urgency. It is a 
challenging programme given as a pastoral responsibility to the entire Church, 
but in a specific way to the lay faithful in her. &quot;The good news of Christ 
continually renews the life and culture of fallen humanity; it combats and 
removes the error and evil which flow from the attraction of sin which are a 
perpetual threat. She never ceases to purify and to elevate the morality of 
peoples... In this way the Church carries out her mission and in that very act 
she stimulates and makes her contribution to human and civic culture. By her 
action, even in its liturgical forms, she leads people to interior 
freedom&quot;(164).</P>
<P>Some particularly significant citations from Paul VI's Exhortation <I>
Evangelii Nuntiandi </I>merit recollection here: &quot;The Church evangelizes when 
she seeks to convert, solely through the divine power of the message she 
proclaims (cf. <I>Rom </I>1:16; <I>1 Cor </I>1:18; 2:4), both the personal and 
collective consciences of people, the activities in which they engage, and the 
lives and concrete milieux which are theirs. Strata of humanity are transformed: 
for the Church it is a question not only of preaching the Gospel in ever-wider 
geographic areas or to ever-greater numbers of people, but also of affecting and 
as it were challenging, through the power of the Gospel, mankind's criteria of 
judgment, determining values, points of interest, lines of thought, sources of 
inspiration and models of life, which are in contrast with the Word of God and 
the plan of salvation. All this could be expressed in the following words: What 
matters is to evangelizehumanity's culture and the cultures of the human 
family... the split between the Gospel and culture is without a doubt the drama 
of our time, just as it was of other times. Therefore, every effort must be made 
to ensure a full evangelization of culture, or more correctly of cultures&quot;(165).</P>
<P>The privileged way at present for the creation and transmission of culture is 
the <I>means of social </I><I>communications</I>(166). The world of the 
massmedia represents a new frontier for the mission of the Church, because it is 
undergoing a rapid and innovative development and has an extensive worldwide 
influence on the formation of mentality and customs. In particular, the lay 
faithful's responsibility as professionals in this field, exercised both by 
individual right and through community initiatives and institutions, demands a 
recognition of all its values, and demands that it be sustained by more adequate 
resource materials, both intellectual and pastoral.</P>
<P>The use of these instruments by professionals in communication and their 
reception by the public demand both a work of education in a critical sense, 
which is animated by a passion for the truth, and a work of defence of liberty, 
respect for the dignity of individuals, and the elevation of the authentic 
culture of peoples which occurs through a firm and courageous rejection of every 
form of monopoly and manipulation.</P>
<P>However, the pastoral responsibility among the lay faithful does not stop 
with this work of defence. It extends to everyone in the world of 
communications, even to those professional people of the press, cinema, radio, 
television and theatre. These also are called to proclaim the gospel that brings 
salvation.</P>

<P><B>CHAPTER IV</B></P> 
<P><B>LABOURERS IN THE LORD'S VINEYARD<BR>Good Stewards of God's Varied Grace</B></P></CENTER>
<P><B><I>The Variety of Vocations </I></B></P>
<P>45. According to the gospel parable, the &quot;householder&quot; calls the labourers 
for his vineyard at <I>various </I>times during the day: some at dawn, others 
about nine in the morning, still others about midday and at three, the last, 
around five (cf. <I>Mt </I>20:1 ff.). In commenting on these words of the 
gospel, Saint Gregory the Great makes a comparison between the various times of 
the call and the different <I>stages in life: </I>&quot;It is possible to compare the 
different hours&quot;, he writes, &quot;to the various stages in a person's life. 
According to our analogy the morning can certainly represent childhood. The 
third hour, then, can refer to adolescence; the sun has now moved to the height 
of heaven, that is, at this stage a person grows in strength. The sixth hour is 
adulthood, the sun is in the middle of the sky, indeed at this age the fullness 
of vitality is obvious. Old age represents the ninth hour, because the sun 
starts its descent from the height of heaven, thus the youthful vitality begins 
to decline. The eleventh hour represents those who are most advanced in years... 
The labourers, then, are called and sent forth into the vineyard at different 
hours, that is to say, one is led to a holy life during childhood, another in 
adolescence, another in adulthood and another in old age&quot;(167).</P>
<P>We can make a further application of the comments of Saint Gregory the Great 
to the extraordinary variety of ways the Church becomes &quot;present&quot; in life; one 
and all are called to work for the coming of the Kingdom of God according to the 
diversity of callings and situations, charisms and ministries. This variety is 
not only linked to age, but also to the difference of sex and to the diversity 
of natural gifts, as well as to careers and conditions affecting a person's 
life. It is a variety that makes the riches of the Church more vital and 
concrete.</P>
<P><B><I>Young People, Children and Older People </I></B></P>
<P><I>Youth, the Hope of the Church</I></P>
<P>46. The Synod wished to <I>give particular attention to the young. </I>And 
rightly so. In a great many countries of the world, they represent half of 
entire populations, and often constitute in number half of the People of God 
itself living in those countries. Simply from this aspect youth make up an 
exceptional potential and a <I>great challenge for the future of the Church. 
</I>In fact the Church sees her path towards the future in the youth, beholding 
in them a reflection of herself and her call to that blessed youthfulness which 
she constantly enjoys as a result of Christ's Spirit. In this sense the Council 
has defined youth as &quot;the hope of the Church&quot;(168).</P>
<P>In the letter of 31 March 1985 to young men and women in the world we read: 
&quot;The Church looks to the youth, indeed the Church in a special way <I>looks at 
herself in the youth, </I>in all of you and in each of you. It has been so from 
the beginning, from apostolic times. The words of St. John in his <I>First 
Letter </I>can serve as special testimony: 'I am writing to you, <I>young 
people, </I>because you <I>have overcome the evil one. </I>I write to you, 
children, because you <I>know the Father... </I><I>I </I>write to you, <I>young 
people, </I>because <I>you are strong </I>and the word of God <I>abides in you 
</I><I>(</I><I>1 Jn</I><I> </I>2:13<I> </I>ff.)... In our generation, at the end 
of the Second Millennium after Christ, the Church also sees herself in the 
youth&quot;(169).</P>
<P>Youth must not simply be considered as an object of pastoral concern for the 
Church: in fact, young people are and ought to be encouraged to be active on 
behalf of the Church as <I>leading characters in evangelization and participants 
in the renewal of </I><I>society.</I>(170) Youth is a time of an especially 
intensive 
<I>discovery </I>of a &quot;self&quot; and &quot;a choice of life&quot;. It is a time for <I>growth </I>
which ought to progress &quot;in wisdom, age and grace before God and people&quot; (<I>Lk </I>
2:52).</P>
<P>The Synod Fathers have commented: &quot;The sensitivity of young people profoundly 
affects their perceiving of the values of justice, nonviolence and peace. Their 
hearts are disposed to fellowship, friendship and solidarity. They are greatly 
moved by causes that relate to the quality of life and the conservation of 
nature. But they are troubled by anxiety, deceptions, anguishes and fears of the 
world as well as by the temptations that come with their state&quot;(171).</P>
<P>The Church must seek to rekindle the very special love displayed by Christ 
towards the young man in the Gospel: &quot;Jesus, looking upon him, loved him&quot; (<I>Mk </I>
10:21). For this reason the Church does not tire of proclaiming Jesus Christ, of 
proclaiming his Gospel as the unique and satisfying response to the most 
deep-seated aspirations of young people, as illustrated in Christ's forceful and 
exalted personal call to discipleship (&quot;Come and follow me.&quot;

<I>Mk </I>10:21), that brings about a sharing in the filial love of Jesus for 
his Father and the participation in his mission for the salvation of humanity.</P>
<P><I>The Church has so much to talk about with youth, and youth have so much to 
share with the Church. </I>This mutual dialogue, by taking place with great 
cordiality, clarity and courage, will provide a favorable setting for the 
meeting and exchange between generations, and will be a source of richness and 
youthfulness for the Church and civil society. In its message to young people 
the Council said: &quot;The Church looks to you with confidence and with love... She 
is the real youthfulness of the world... Look upon the Church and you will find 
in her the face of Christ&quot;(172).</P>
<P><B><I>Children and the Kingdom of Heaven</I></B></P>
<P>47. Children are certainly the object of the Lord Jesus' tender and generous 
love. To them he gave his blessing, and, even more, to them he promised the 
Kingdom of heaven (cf. <I>Mt </I><I>19:</I>13-15; <I>Mk </I>10:14). In 
particular Jesus exalted the active role that little ones have in the Kingdom of 
God. They are the eloquent symbol and exalted image of those moral and spiritual 
conditions that are essential for entering into the Kingdom of God and for 
living the logic of total confidence in the Lord: &quot;Truly I say to you, unless 
you turn and become like children. vou will never enter the Kingdom of heaven. 
Whoever humbles himself like this child, he is the greatest in the Kingdom of 
heaven&quot; (<I>Mt </I>18, 3-5; cf. <I>Lk </I>9:48).</P>
<P>Children are a continual reminder that the missionary fruitfulness of the 
Church has its life-giving basis not in human means and merits, but in the 
absolute gratuitous gift of God. The life itself of innocence and grace of many 
children, and even the suffering and oppression unjustly inflicted upon them are 
in virtue of the Cross of Christ a source of spiritual enrichment for them and 
for the entire Church. Everyone ought to be more conscious and grateful for this 
fact.</P>
<P>Furthermore, it must be acknowledged that valuable possibilities exist even 
in the life's stages of infancy and childhood, both for the building up of the 
Church and for making society more humane. How often the Council referred to the 
beneficial and constructive affects for the family, &quot;the domestic Church&quot;, 
through the presence of sons and daughters: &quot;Children as living members of the 
family, contribute in their in their own way to the sanctification of their 
parents&quot;(173). The Council's words must also be repeated about children in 
relation to the local and universal Church. John Gerson, a great theologian and 
educator of the 15th Century, had already emphasized this fact in stating that 
&quot;children and young people are in no way a negligible part of the Church&quot;(174).</P>
<P><B><I>Older People and the Gift of Wisdom</I></B></P>
<P>48. I now address older people, oftentimes unjustly considered as 
unproductive, if not directly an insupportable burden. I remind older people 
that the Church calls and expects them to continue to exercise their mission in 
the apostolic and missionary life. This is not only a possibility for them, but 
it is their duty even in this time in their life when age itself provides 
opportunities in some specific and basic way.</P>
<P>The Bible delights in presenting the older person as the symbol of someone 
rich in wisdom and fear of the Lord (cf. <I>Sir </I>25:4-6). In this sense the 
&quot;gift&quot; of older people can be specifically that of being the witness to 
tradition in the faith both in the Church and in society (cf. <I>Ps </I>44: 2;<I> 
Ex</I> 
12:26-27), the teacher of the lessons of life (cf. <I>Sir </I>6:34; 8:11-12), 
and the worker of charity.</P>
<P>At this moment the growing number of older people in different countries 
worldwide and the expected retirement of persons from various professions and 
the workplace provides older people with a new opportunity in the apostolate. 
Involved in the task is their determination to overcome the temptation of taking 
refuge in a nostalgia in a never-to-return past or fleeing from present 
responsibility because of difficulties encountered in a world of one novelty 
after another. They must always have a clear knowledge that one's role in the 
Church and society does not stop at a certain age at all, but at such times 
knows only new ways of application. As the Psalmist says: &quot;They still bring 
forth fruit in old age, they are ever full of sap and green, to show that the 
Lord is upright&quot; (<I>Ps </I>92:15-16). I repeat all that I said during the 
celebration of the Older People's Jubilee: &quot;Arriving at an older age is to be 
considered a privilege: not simply because not everyone has the good fortune to 
reach this stage in life, but also, and above all, because this period provides 
real possibilities for better evaluating the past, for knowing and living more 
deeply the Paschal Mystery, for becoming an example in the Church for the whole 
People of God... Despite the complex nature of the problems you face: a strength 
that progressively diminishes, the insufficiencies of social organizations, 
official legislation that comes late, or the lack of understanding by a 
self-centered society, you are not to feel yourselves as persons underestimated 
in the life of the Church or as passive objects in a fast-paced world, but as 
participants at a time of life which is humanly and spiritually fruitful. You 
still have a mission to fulfill, a contribution to make. According to the divine 
plan, each individual human being lives a life of continual growth, from the 
beginning of existence to the moment at which the last breath is taken&quot;(175).</P>
<P><B><I>Women and Men</I></B></P>
<P>49. The Synod Fathers gave special attention to the status and role of women, 
with two purposes in mind: to themselves acknowledge and to invite all others to 
once again acknowledge the indispensable contribution of women to the building 
up of the Church and the development of society. They wished as well to work on 
a more specific analysis of women's participation in the life and mission of the 
Church.</P>
<P>Making reference to Pope John XXIII, who saw women's greater consciousness of 
their proper dignity and their entrance into public life as signs of our 
times(176), the Synod Fathers, when confronted with the various forms of 
discrimination and marginization to which women are subjected simply because 
they are women, time and time again strongly affirmed the urgency to defend and 
to promote the <I>personal dignity of woman, </I>and consequently, her equality 
with man.</P>
<P>If anyone has this task of advancing the dignity of women in the Church and 
society, it is women themselves, who must recognize their responsibility as 
leading characters. There is still much effort to be done, in many parts of the 
world and in various surroundings, to destroy that unjust and deleterious 
mentality which considers the human being as a thing, as an object to buy and 
sell, as an instrument for selfish interests or for pleasure only. Women 
themselves, for the most part, are the prime victims of such a mentality. Only 
through openly acknowledging the personal dignity of women is the first step 
taken to promote the full participation of women in Church life as well as in 
social and public life. A more extensive and decisive response must be given to 
the demands made in the Exhortation <I>Familiaris Consortio </I>concerning the 
many discriminations of which women are the victims: &quot;Vigorous and incisive 
pastoral action must be taken by all to overcome completely these forms of 
discrimination so that the image of God that shines in all human beings without 
exception may be fully respected&quot;(177). Along the same lines, the Synod Fathers 
stated: &quot;As an expression of her mission the Church must stand firmly against 
all forms of discrimination and abuse of women&quot;(178). And again: &quot;The dignity of 
women, gravely wounded in public esteem, must be restored through effective 
respect for the rights of the human person and by putting the teaching of the 
Church into practice&quot;(179).</P>
<P>In particular when speaking of <I>active and responsible participation in the 
life and mission of the Church, </I>emphasis should be placed on what has 
already been stated and clearly urged by the Second Vatican Council: &quot;Since in 
our days women are taking an increasingly active share in the whole life of 
society, it is very important that they participate more widely also in the 
various fields of the Church's apostolate&quot;(180).</P>
<P>The awareness that women with their own gifts and tasks have <I>their own 
specific vocation, </I>has increased and been deepened in the years following 
the Council and has found its fundamental inspiration in the Gospel and the 
Church's history. In fact, for the believer the Gospel, namely, the word and 
example of Jesus Christ, remains the necessary and decisive point of reference. 
In no other moment in history is this fact more fruitful and innovative.</P>
<P>Though not called to the apostolate of the Twelve, and thereby, to the 
ministerial priesthood, many women, nevertheless, accompanied Jesus in his 
ministry and assisted the group of Apostles (cf. <I>Lk </I>8:2-3), were present 
at the foot of the Cross (cf. <I>Lk </I>23:49), assisted at the burial of Christ 
(cf. <I>Lk</I><I> </I>23:55) received and transmitted the message of 
resurrection on Easter morn (cf. <I>Lk </I>24:1-10), and prayed with the 
apostles in the Cenacle awaiting Pentecost (cf<I>. Acts </I>1:14).</P>
<P>From the evidence of the Gospel, the Church at its origin detached herself 
from the culture of the time and called women to tasks connected with spreading 
the gospel. In his letters the Apostle Paul even cites by name a great number of 
women for their various functions in service of the primitive Christian 
community (cf. <I>Rom </I>16:1-15; <I>Phil </I>4:2-3;<I> Col </I>4:15 and 
<I>1 Cor </I>11:5; <I>1 Tim </I>5:16). &quot;If the witness of the Apostles founds 
the Church&quot;, stated Paul VI, &quot;the witness of women contributes greatly towards 
nourishing the faith of Christian communities&quot;(181).</P>
<P>Both in her earliest days and in her successive development the Church, 
albeit in different ways and with diverse emphases, has always known women who 
have exercised an oftentimes decisive role in the Church herself and 
accomplished tasks of considerable value on her behalf. History is marked by 
grand works, quite often lowly and hidden, but not for this reason any less 
decisive to the growth and the holiness of the Church. It is necessary that this 
history continue, indeed that it be expanded and intensified in the face of the 
growing and widespread awareness of the personal dignity of woman and her 
vocation, particularly in light of the urgency of a &quot;re-evangelization&quot; and a 
major effort towards &quot;humanizing&quot; social relations.</P>
<P>Gathering together the pronouncements of the Second Vatican Council, which 
reflect the Gospel's message and the Church's history, the Synod Fathers 
formulated, among others, this precise &quot;recommendation&quot;: &quot;It is necessary that 
the Church recognize all the gifts of men and women for her life and mission, 
and put them<B> </B>into practice&quot;(182). And again, &quot;This Synod proclaims that 
the Church seeks the recognition and use of all the gifts, experiences and 
talents of men and women to make her mission effective (cf. Congregation for the 
Doctrine of the Faith, <I>Instruction on Christian Freedom and Liberation, </I>
72)&quot;(183).</P>
<P><B><I>Anthropological and Theological Foundations</I></B></P>
<P>50. The condition that will assure the rightful presence of woman in the 
Church and in society is a more penetrating and accurate consideration of the 
<I>anthropological foundation for masculinity and femininity </I>with the intent 
of clarifying woman's personal identity in relation to man, that is, a diversity 
yet mutual complementarity, not only as it concerns roles to be held and 
functions to be performed, but also, and more deeply, as it concerns her make-up 
and meaning as a person.</P>
<P>The Synod Fathers have deeply felt this requirement, maintaining that &quot;the 
anthropological and theological foundations for resolving questions about the 
true significance and dignity of each sex require deeper study&quot;(184).</P>
<P>Through committing herself to a reflection on the anthropological and 
theological basis of femininity, the Church enters the historic process of the 
various movements for the promotion of woman, and, in going to the very basic 
aspect of woman as a personal being, provides her most precious contribution. 
But even before this the Church intends, in such a way, to obey God, who created 
the individual &quot;in his image&quot;, &quot;male and female he created them&quot;

<I>(Gen </I>1:27) and who intended that they would accept the call of God to 
come to know, reverence and live his plan. It is a plan that &quot;from the 
beginning&quot; has been indelibly imprinted in the very being of the human 
person-men and women-and, therefore, in the make-up, meaning and deepest 
workings of the individual. This most wise and loving plan must be explored to 
discover all its richness of content-a richness that &quot;from the beginning&quot; came 
to be progressively manifested and realized in the whole history of salvation, 
and was brought to completion in &quot;the fullness of time&quot;, when &quot;God sent his Son, 
born of a woman&quot; <I>(Gal </I>4:4). That &quot;fullness&quot; continues in history: God's 
plan for woman is read and is to be read within the context of the faith of the 
Church, and also, in the lives lived by so many Christian women today. Without 
forgetting the help that can come from different human sciences and cultures, 
researchers because of an informed discernment, will be able to help gather and 
clarify the values and requirements that belong to the enduring essential 
aspects of women and those bound to evolve in history. The Second Vatican 
Council reminds us: &quot;The Church maintains that beneath all changes there are 
many realities which do not change; these find their ultimate foundation in 
Christ, who is the same yesterday, and today, and forever (cf. <I>Heb </I>
13:8)&quot;(185). The Apostolic Letter on the Dignity and Vocation of Woman gives 
much attention to the anthropological and theological foundation of woman's 
dignity as a person. The document seeks to again treat and develop the 
catechetical reflections of the Wednesday General Audiences devoted over a long 
period of time to the &quot;theology of the body&quot;, while at the same time fulfilling 
a promise made in the Encyclical <I>Redemptoris Mater</I>(186) and serving as a 
response to the request of the Synod Fathers.</P>
<P>May the reading of the Apostolic Letter <I>Mulieris Dignitatem, </I>in 
particular, as a biblical theological meditation, be an incentive for everyone, 
both women and men, and especially for those who devote their lives to the human 
sciences and theological disciplines, to pursue on the basis of the personal 
dignity of man and woman and their mutual relationship, a critical study to 
better and more deeply understand the values and specific gifts of femininity 
and masculinity, not only in the surroundings of social living but also and 
above all in living as Christians and as members of the Church.</P>
<P>This meditation on the anthropological and theological foundations of women 
ought to enlighten and guide the Christian response to the most frequently asked 
questions, oftentimes so crucial, on <I>the &quot;place&quot; that women can have and 
ought to have in the Church and in society.</I></P>
<P>It is quite clear from the words and attitude of Christ, which are normative 
for the Church, that no discrimination exists on the level of an individual's 
relation to Christ, in which &quot;there is neither male nor female; for you are all 
one in Christ Jesus&quot; <I>(Gal </I>3:28)<I> </I>and on the level of participation 
in the Church's life of grace and holiness, as Joel's prophecy fulfilled at 
Pentecost wonderfully attests: &quot;I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; your 
sons and daughters shall prophecy&quot; <I>(Joel </I>3:1; cf. 
<I>Acts 
</I>2:17 ff). As the Apostolic Letter on the Dignity and Vocation of Woman 
reads: &quot;Both women and men ... are equally capable of receiving the outpouring 
of divine truth and love in the Holy Spirit. Both receive his salvific and 
sanctifying 'visits'&quot;(187).</P>
<P><B><I>Mission in the Church and in the World</I></B></P>
<P>51. In speaking about participation in the apostolic mission of the Church, 
there is no doubt that in virtue of Baptism and Confirmation, a woman-as well as 
a man-is made a sharer in the threefold mission of Jesus Christ, Priest, Prophet 
and King, and is thereby charged and given the ability to fulfill the 
fundamental apostolate of the Church: <I>evangelization. </I>However, a woman is 
called to put to work in this apostolate the &quot;gifts&quot; which are properly hers: 
first of all, the gift that is her very dignity as a person exercised in word 
and testimony of life, gifts therefore, connected with her vocation as a woman.</P>
<P>In her participation in the life and mission of the Church a woman cannot 
receive the <I>Sacrament of Orders, </I>and therefore, cannot fulfil the proper 
function of the ministerial priesthood. This is a practice that the Church has 
always found in the expressed will of Christ, totally free and sovereign, who 
called only men to be his apostles(188); a practice that can be understood from 
the rapport between Christ, the Spouse, and his Bride, the Church(189). Here we 
are in the area of <I>function, </I>not of <I>dignity </I>and <I>holiness. 
</I>In fact, it must be maintained: &quot;Although the Church possesses a 
'hierarchical' structure, nevertheless this structure is totally ordered to the 
holiness of Christ's members&quot;(190).</P>
<P>However, as Paul VI has already said, &quot;We cannot change what our Lord did, 
nor his call to women; but we can recognize and promote the role of women in the 
mission of evangelization and in the life of the Christian community(191).</P>
<P>Above all the <I>acknowledgment in theory </I>of the active and responsible 
presence of woman in the Church must be <I>realized in practice. </I>With this 
in mind this Exhortation addressed to the lay faithful with its deliberate and 
repeated use of the terms &quot;women and men&quot;, must be read. Furthermore the revised 
Code of Canon Law contains many provisions on the participation of women in the 
life and mission of the Church: they are provisions that must be more commonly 
known and, according to the diverse sensibilities of culture and opportuneness 
in a pastoral situation, be realized with greater timeliness and determination.</P>
<P>An example comes to mind in the participation of women on diocesan and 
parochial Pastoral Councils as well as Diocesan Synods and particular Councils. 
In this regard the Synod Fathers have written: &quot;Without discrimination women 
should be participants in the life of the Church, and also in consultation and 
the process of coming to decisions&quot;(192).And again: &quot;Women, who already hold 
places of great importance in transmitting the faith and offering every kind of 
service in the life of the Church, ought to be associated in the preparation of 
pastoral and missionary documents and ought to be recognized as cooperators in 
the mission of the church in the family, in professional life and in the civil 
community&quot;(193).</P>
<P>In the more specific area of evangelization and catechesis the particular 
work that women have in the transmission of the faith, not only in the family 
but also in the various educational environments, is to be more strongly 
fostered. In broader terms, this should be applied in all that regard embracing 
the Word of God, its understanding and its communication, as well as its study, 
research and theological teaching.</P>
<P>While she is to fulfill her duty to evangelize, woman is to feel more acutely 
her need to be evangelized. Thus, with her vision illumined by faith (cf. <I>Eph </I>
1:18), woman is to be able to distinguish what truly responds to her dignity as 
a person and to her vocation from all that, under the pretext of this &quot;dignity&quot; 
and in the name of &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;progress&quot;, militates against true values. On 
the contrary, these false values become responsible for the moral degradation of 
the person, the environment and society. This same &quot;discernment&quot;, made possible 
and demanded from Christian women's participation in the prophetic mission of 
Christ and his Church, recurs with continued urgency throughout history. This 
&quot;discernment&quot;, often mentioned by the Apostle Paul, is not only a matter of 
evaluating reality and events in the light of faith, but also involves a real 
decision and obligation to employ it, not only in Church life but also in human 
society.</P>
<P>It can be said that the problems of today's world already cited in the second 
part of the Council's Constitution <I>Gaudium et Spes, </I>which remain 
unresolved and not at all affected by the passage of time, must witness the 
presence and commitment of women with their irreplaceable and customary 
contributions.</P>
<P>In particular, two great tasks entrusted to women merit the attention of 
everyone.</P>
<P>First of all, the task of <I>bringing full dignity to the conjugal lite and 
to motherhood. </I>Today new possibilities are opened to women for a deeper 
understanding and a richer realization of human and Christian values implied in 
the conjugal life and the experience of motherhood. Man himself-husband and 
father-can be helped to overcome forms of absenteeism and of periodic presence 
as well as a partial fulfilment of parental responsibilities-indeed he can be 
involved in new and significant relations of interpersonal communion-precisely 
as a result of the intelligent, loving and decisive intervention of woman.</P>
<P>Secondly, women have the task of <I>assuring the moral dimension </I><I>of

</I><I>culture, </I>the dimension, namely of <I>a culture worthy </I><I>of 
</I><I>the person, </I>of an individual yet social life. The Second Vatican 
Council seems to connect the moral dimension of culture with the participation 
of the lay faithful in the kingly mission of Christ: &quot;Let the lay faithful by 
their combined efforts remedy the institutions and conditions of the world when 
the latter are an inducement to sin, that all such things may be conformed to 
the norms of justice, and may favor the practice of virtue rather than hindering 
it. By so doing, they will infuse culture and human works with a moral 
value&quot;(194).</P>
<P>As women increasingly participate more fully and responsibly in the 
activities of institutions which are associated with safeguarding the basic duty 
to human values in various communities, the words of the Council just quoted 
point to an important field in the apostolate of women: in all aspects of the 
life of such communities, from the socio-economic to the sociopolitical 
dimension, the personal dignity of woman and her specific vocation ought to be 
respected and promoted. Likewise this should be the case in living situations 
not only affecting the individual but also communities, not only in forms left 
to personal freedom and responsibility, but even in those guaranteed by just 
civil laws.</P>
<P>&quot;It is not good for man to be alone: let us make him a helper fit for him&quot; <I>
(Gen </I>2:18).<I> God entrusted the human being to woman. </I>Certainly, every 
human being is entrusted to each and every other human being, but in a special 
way the human being is entrusted to woman, precisely because the woman in virtue 
of her special experience of motherhood is seen to have a <I>specific 
sensitivity </I>towards the human person and all that constitutes the 
individual's true welfare, beginning with the fundamental value of life. How 
great are the possibilities and responsibilities of woman in this area, at a 
time when the development of science and technology is not always inspired and 
measured by true wisdom, with the inevitable risk of &quot;de-humanizing&quot; human life, 
above all when it would demand a more intense love and a more generous 
acceptance.</P>
<P>The participation of women in the life of the Church and society in the 
sharing of her gifts is likewise the path necessary of her personal 
fulfillment-on which so many justly insist today-and the basic contribution of 
woman to the enrichment of Church communion and the dynamism in the apostolate 
of the People of God.</P>
<P>From this perspective the presence also of men, together with women, ought to 
be considered.</P>
<P><B><I>The Presence and Collaboration of Men Together with Women</I></B></P>
<P>52. Many voices were raised in the Synod Hall expressing the fear that 
excessive insistence given to the status and role of women would lead to an 
unacceptable omission, that, in point, regarding <I>men. </I>In reality, various 
sectors in the Church must lament the absence or the scarcity of the presence of 
men, some of whom abdicate their proper Church responsibilities, allowing them 
to be fulfilled only by women. Such instances are participation in the 
liturgical prayer of the Church, education and, in particular, catechesis of 
their own sons and daughters and other children, presence at religious and 
cultural meetings, and collaboration in charitable and missionary initiatives.</P>
<P>Therefore, the coordinated presence of both men and women is to be pastorally 
urged so that the participation of the lay faithful in the salvific mission of 
the Church might be rendered more rich, complete and harmonious.</P>
<P>The fundamental reason that requires and explains the presence and the 
collaboration of both men and women is not only, as it was just emphasized, the 
major source of meaning and efficacy in the pastoral action of the Church, nor 
even less is it the simple sociological fact of sharing a life together as human 
beings, which is natural for man and woman. It is, rather, the original plan of 
the Creator who from the &quot;beginning&quot; willed the human being to be a &quot;unity of 
the two&quot;, and willed man and woman to be the prime community of persons, source 
of every other community, and, at the same time, to be a &quot;sign&quot; of that 
interpersonal communion of love which constitutes the mystical, intimate life of 
God, One in Three.</P>
<P>Precisely for this reason, the most common and widespread way, and at the 
same time, fundamental way, to assure this coordinated and harmonious presence 
of men and women in the life and mission of the Church, is the fulfilment of the 
tasks and responsibilities of the couple and the Christian family, in which the 
variety of diverse forms of life and love is seen and communicated: conjugal, 
paternal and maternal, filial and familial. We read in the Exhortation <I>
Familiaris Consortio: &quot;</I>Since the Christian family is a community in which 
the relationships are renewed by Christ through faith and the sacraments, the 
family's sharing in the Church's mission should follow <I>a community pattern: 
</I>the spouses together <I>as a couple, </I>the parents and children <I>as a 
family, </I>must live their service to the Church and to the world ... The 
Christian family also builds up the Kingdom of God in history through the 
everyday realities that concern and distinguish its <I>state of life: </I>it is 
thus in the <I>love between husband and wife and between members of the family-</I>a 
love lived out in all its extraordinary richness of values and demands: 
totality, oneness, fidelity and fruitfulness-that the Christian family's 
participation in the prophetic, priestly and kingly mission of Jesus Christ and 
of his Church finds expression and realization&quot;(195).</P>
<P>From this perspective, the Synod Fathers have recalled the meaning that the 
Sacrament of Matrimony ought to assume in the Church and society in order to 
illuminate and inspire all the relations between men and women. In this regard 
they have emphasized an &quot; urgent need for every Christian to live and proclaim 
the message of hope contained in the relation between man and woman. The 
Sacrament of Matrimony, which consecrates this relation in its conjugal form and 
reveals it as a sign of the relation of Christ with his Church, contains a 
teaching of great importance for the Church's life-a teaching that ought to 
reach today's world through the Church; all those relations between man and 
woman must be imbued by this spirit. The Church should even more fully rely on 
the riches found here&quot;(196). These same Fathers have rightly emphasized that 
&quot;the esteem for virginity and reverence for motherhood must be respectively 
restored&quot;(197), and still again they have called for the development of diverse 
and complementary vocations in the living context of Church communion and in the 
service of its continued growth.</P>
<P><B><I>The Sick and the Suffering </I></B></P>
<P>53. People are called to joy. Nevertheless, each day they experience many 
forms of suffering and pain. The Synod Fathers in addressing men and women 
affected by these various forms of suffering and pain used the following words 
in their final <I>Message: </I><I>&quot;You</I><I> </I>who are the abandoned and 
pushed to the edges of our consumer society; you who are sick, people with 
disabilities, the poor and hungry, migrants and prisoners, refugees, unemployed, 
abandoned children and old people who feel alone; you who are victims of war and 
all kinds of violence: the Church reminds you that she shares your suffering. 
She takes it to the Lord, who in turn associates you with his redeeming Passion. 
You are brought to life in the light of his resurrection. We need you to teach 
the whole world what love is. We will do everything we can so that you may find 
your rightful place in the Church and in society&quot;(198).</P>
<P>In the context of such a limitless world as human suffering, We now turn our 
attention to all those struck down by sickness in its various forms: sickness is 
indeed the most frequent and common expression of human suffering.</P>
<P>The Lord addresses his call to each and every one. <I>Even the sick are sent 
forth as labourers into the Lord's vineyard: </I><I></I>the weight that wearies 
the body's members and dissipates the soul's serenity is far from dispensing a 
person from working in the vineyard. Instead the sick are called to live their 
human and Christian vocation and to participate in the growth of the Kingdom of 
God in a 
<I>new and even more valuable manner. </I>The words of the apostle Paul ought to 
become their approach to life or, better yet, cast an illumination to permit 
them to see the meaning of grace in their very situation: &quot;In my flesh I 
complete what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that 
is, the Church&quot; <I>(Col </I>1:24). Precisely in arriving at this realization, 
the apostle is raised up in joy: &quot;I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake&quot; <I>
(Col </I>1:24). In the same way many of the sick can become bearers of the &quot;joy 
inspired by the Holy Spirit in much affliction&quot; (<I>1</I> <I>Thes </I>1:6) and 
witnesses to Jesus' resurrection. A handicapped person expressed these 
sentiments in a presentation in the Synod Hall: &quot;It is very important to make 
clear that Christians who live in situations of illness, pain and old age are 
called by God not only to unite their suffering to Christ's Passion but also to 
receive in themselves now, and to transmit to others, the power of renewal and 
the joy of the risen Christ (cf. <I>2 Cor </I>4:10-11; 
<I>1</I> <I>Pt </I>4:13; <I>Rom</I> 8:18 ff)&quot;(199).</P>
<P>On the Church's part-as it reads in the Apostolic Letter <I>Salvifici 
Doloris-</I><I>&quot;Born</I><I> </I>in the mystery of Redemption in the Cross of 
Christ, the Church has to try to <I>meet </I>man in a special way on the path of 
suffering. In this meeting man 'becomes the way for the Church', and this is one 
of the most important ways&quot;(200). At this moment <I>the suffering individual is 
the way of the Church </I>because that person is, first of all, the way of 
Christ Himself, who is the Good Samaritan who &quot;does not pass by&quot;, but &quot;has 
compassion on him, went to him ... bound up his wounds ... took care of him&quot; <I>
(Lk </I>10:32-34).</P>
<P>From century to century the Christian community in revealing and 
communicating its healing love and the consolation of Jesus Christ has reenacted 
the gospel parable of the Good Samaritan in caring for the vast multitude of 
persons who are sick and suffering. This came about through the untiring 
commitment of all those who have taken care of the sick and suffering as a 
result of science and the medical arts as well as the skilled and generous 
service of healthcare workers. Today there is an increase in the presence of lay 
women and men in Catholic hospital and healthcare institutions. At times the lay 
faithful's presence in these institutions is total and exclusive. It is to just 
such people-doctors, nurses, other healthcare workers, volunteers-that the call 
becomes the living signof Jesus Christ and his Church in showing love towards 
the sick and suffering.</P>
<P><B><I>Renewed Pastoral Action</I></B></P>
<P>54. It is necessary that this most precious heritage, which the Church has 
received from Jesus Christ, &quot;Physician of the body and the spirit&quot;(201), must 
never diminish but always must come to be more valued and enriched through 
renewal and decisive initiatives of <I>pastoral activity for and with the sick 
and suffering. </I>This activity must be capable of sustaining and fostering 
attention, nearness, presence, listening, dialogue, sharing, and real help 
toward individuals in moments when sickness and suffering sorely test not only 
faith in life but also faith in God and his love as Father. <span lang="EN-US">
Such pastoral initiatives find most meaningful expression in sacramental 
celebrations with and for the sick, as a source of strength amid pain and 
weakness, hope amid despair, and as an occasion of joyful encounter. </span></P>
<P>One of the basic objectives of this renewed and intensified pastoral action, 
which must involve all components of the ecclesial community in a coordinated 
way, is an attitude which looks upon the sick person, the bearer of a handicap, 
or the suffering individual, not simply as an <I>object </I>of the Church's love 
and service, but as an <I>active and responsible participant in the work of 
evangelization and salvation. </I>From this perspective the Church has to let 
the good news resound within a society and culture, which, having lost the sense 
of human suffering, &quot;censors&quot; all talk on such a hard reality of life. Thegood 
news is the proclamation that suffering can even have a positive meaning for the 
individual and for society itself, since each person is called to a form of 
participation in the salvific suffering of Christ and in the joy of 
resurrection, as well as, thereby, to become a force for the sanctification and 
building up of the Church.</P>
<P>The proclamation of this good news gains credibility when it is not simply 
voiced in words, but passes into a testimony of life, both in the case of all 
those who lovingly care for the sick, the handicapped and the suffering, as well 
as the suffering themselves who are increasingly made more conscious and 
responsible of their place and task within and on behalf of the Church.</P>
<P>In order that &quot;the civilization of love&quot; can flourish and produce fruit in 
this vast world of<B> </B>human pain, I invite all to reread and meditate on the 
Apostolic Letter, <I>Salvifici Doloris,</I> from which I am pleased to again 
propose the lines from its conclusion: &quot;There should come together in spirit 
beneath the Cross of Calvary all suffering people who believe in Christ, and 
particularly those who suffer because of their faith in him who is the Crucified 
and Risen One, so that the offering of their sufferings may hasten the 
fulfilment of the prayer of the Saviour himself that all may be one. Let there 
also gather beneath the Cross all people of good will, for on this Cross is the 
'Redeemer of Man', the Man of Sorrows, who has taken upon himself the physical 
and moral sufferings of the people of all times, so that <I>in love </I>they may 
find the salvific meaning of their sorrow and valid answers to all their 
questions.</P>
<P><I>Together with Mary, </I>Mother of Christ, who <I>stood beneath the Cross, </I>
we pause beside all the crosses of contemporary man and we ask all of

<I>you who suffer </I>to support us. We ask precisely you who are weak to <I>
become a source of strength </I>for the Church and humanity. In the terrible 
battle between the forces of good and evil revealed to our eyes by our modern 
world, may your sufferings in union with the Cross of Christ be 
victorious&quot;(202).</P>
<P><B><I>The States of Life and Vocations </I></B></P>
<P>55. All the members of the People of God -clergy, men and women religious, 
the lay faithful-are labourers in the vineyard. At one and the same time they 
all are the goal and subjects of Church communion as well as of participation in 
the mission of salvation. Every one of us possessing charisms and ministries, 
diverse yet complementary, works in the one and the same vineyard of the Lord.</P>
<P>Simply in <I>being </I>Christians, even before actually <I>doing </I>the 
works of a Christian, all are branches of the one fruitful vine which is Christ.</P>
<P>All are living members of the one Body of the Lord built up through the power 
of the Spirit. The significance of &quot;being&quot; a Christian does not come about 
simply from the life of grace and holiness which is the primary and more 
productive source of the apostolic and missionary fruitfulness of Holy Mother 
Church. Its meaning also arises from the state of life that characterizes the 
clergy, men and women religious, members of secular institutes and the lay 
faithful.</P>
<P>In Church Communion the states of life by being ordered one to the other are 
thus bound together among themselves. They all share in a deeply basic meaning: 
that of being <I>the manner of living out the commonly shared Christian dignity 
and the universal call to holiness in the perfection of love. </I>They are <I>
different yet complementary, </I>in the sense that each of them has a basic and 
unmistakable character which sets each apart, while at the same time each of 
them is seen in relation to the other and placed at each other's service.</P>
<P>Thus the <I>lay </I>state of life has its distinctive feature in its secular 
character. It fulfills an ecclesial service in bearing witness and, in its own 
way recalling for priests, women and men religious, the significance of the 
earthly and temporal realities in the salvific plan of God. In turn, the 
<I>ministerial </I>priesthood represents in different times and places, the 
permanent guarantee of the sacramental presence of Christ, the Redeemer. The 
religious state bears witness to the eschatological character of the Church, 
that is, the straining towards the Kingdom of God that is prefigured and in some 
way anticipated and experienced even now through the vows of chastity, poverty 
and obedience.</P>
<P>All the states of life, whether taken collectively or individually in 
relation to the others, are at the service of the Church's growth. While 
different in expression they are deeply united in the Church's &quot;mystery of 
communion&quot; and are dynamically coordinated in its unique mission.</P>
<P>Thus in the diversity of the states of life and the variety of vocations this 
same, unique mystery of the Church reveals and experiences anew <I>the infinite 
richness of the mystery of Jesus Christ. </I>The Fathers were fond of referring 
to the Church as a field of a pleasing and wonderful variety of herbs, plants, 
flowers and fruits. Saint Ambrose writes: &quot;A field produces many fruits, but the 
one which has an abundance of both fruits and flowers is far better. The field 
of holy Church is fruitful in both one and the other. In this field there are 
the priceless buds of virginity blossoming forth, widowhood stands out boldly as 
the forest in the plain; elsewhere the rich harvest of weddings blessed by the 
Church fills the great granary of the world with abundant produce, and the 
wine-presses of the Lord Jesus overflow with the grapes of a productive vine, 
enriches Christian marriages&quot;(203).</P>
<P><B><I>The Various Vocations in the Lay State</I></B></P>
<P>56. The Church's rich variety is manifested still further from within each 
state of life. Thus <I>within the lay state diverse &quot;vocations&quot; are given, </I>
that is, there are different paths in the spiritual life and the apostolate 
which are taken by individual members of the lay faithful. In the field of a 
&quot;commonly shared&quot; lay vocation &quot;special&quot; lay vocations flourish. In this area we 
can also recall the spiritual experience of the flourishing of diverse forms of 
secular institutes that have developed recently in the Church. These offer the 
lay faithful, and even priests, the possibility of professing the evangelical 
counsels of poverty, chastity and obedience through vows or promises, while 
fully maintaining one's lay or clerical state(204). In this regard the Synod 
Fathers have commented, &quot;The Holy Spirit stirs up other forms of self-giving to 
which people who remain fully in the lay state devote themselves&quot;(205).</P>
<P>We can conclude by reading a beautiful passage taken from Saint Francis de 
Sales, who promoted lay spirituality so well(206). In speaking of &quot;devotion&quot;, 
that is, Christian perfection or &quot;life according to the Spirit&quot;, he presents in 
a simple yet insightful way the vocation of all Christians to holiness while 
emphasizing the specific form with which individual Christians fulfill it: &quot;In 
creation God commanded the plants to bring forth their fruits, each one after 
its kind. So does he command all Christians, who are the living plants of his 
Church, to bring forth the fruits of devotion, each according to his character 
and vocation. Devotion must be exercised in different ways by the gentleman, the 
workman, the servant, the prince, the widow, the maid and the married woman. Not 
only this, but the practice of devotion must also be adapted to the strength, 
the employment, and the duties of each one in particular ... It is an error, or 
rather a heresy, to try to banish the devout life from the regiment of soldiers, 
the shop of the mechanic, the court of princes, or the home of married folk. It 
is true, Philothea, that a purely contemplative, monastic and religious devotion 
cannot be exercised in such ways of life. But besides these three kinds of 
devotion, there are several others adapted to bring to perfection those who live 
in the secular state&quot;(207).</P>
<P>Along the same line the Second Vatican Council states: &quot;This lay spirituality 
should take its particular character from the circumstances of one's state in 
life (married and familylife, celibacy, widowhood), from one's state of health 
and from one's professional and social activity. All should not cease to develop 
earnestly the qualities and talents bestowed on them in accord with these 
conditions of life and should make use of the gifts which they have received 
from the Holy Spirit&quot;(208).</P>
<P>What has been said about the spiritual vocation can also be said-and to a 
certain degree with greater reason-of the infinite number of ways through which 
all members of the Church are employed as labourers in the vineyard of the Lord, 
building up the Mystical Body of Christ. Indeed as a person with a truly unique 
lifestory, each is called by name, to make a special contribution to the coming 
of the Kingdom of God. No talent, no matter how small, is to be hidden or left 
unused (cf.<I> Mt</I> 25:24-27).</P>
<P>In this regard the apostle Peter gives us a stern warning: &quot;As each has 
received a gift, employ it for one another, as good stewards of God's varied 
grace&quot; (<I>1 Pt</I> 4:10).</P>

<P><B>CHAPTER V</B></P> 
<P><B>THAT YOU BEAR MUCH FRUIT<BR>The Formation of the Lay Faithful in the Lay 
State</B></P></CENTER>
<P><B><I>A Continual Process of Maturation </I></B></P>
<P>57. The gospel image of the vine and the branches reveals to us another 
fundamental aspect of the lay faithful's life and mission:<B> </B><I>the call to 
growth and a continual process of maturation, of always bearing much fruit.</I></P>
<P>As a diligent vinedresser, the Father takes care of his vine. God's 
solicitude is so ardently called upon by Israel, that she prays: &quot;Turn again, O 
God of hosts! / Look down from heaven, and see; / have regard for this vine, / 
the stock which your right hand has planted&quot; (Ps 80:15-16). Jesus himself speaks 
of the Father's work: &quot;I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. 
Every branch of mine that bears no fruit, he takes away. and every branch that 
does bear fruit, he prunes that it may bear more fruit&quot; (<I>Jn</I>
 15:1-2).</P>
<P>The vitality of the branches depends on their remaining attached to the vine, 
which is Jesus Christ: <I>&quot;He who abides in me and I in him bears much fruit, </I>
for apart from me you can do nothing&quot; (<I>Jn</I> 15:5).</P>
<P>People are approached in liberty by God who calls everyone to grow, develop 
and bear fruit. A person cannot put off a response nor cast off personal 
responsibility in the matter. The solemn words of Jesus refer to this exalted 
and serious responsibility: &quot;If a man does not abide in me, he is cast forth as 
a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and 
burned&quot; (<I>Jn</I> 15:6).</P>
<P>In this dialogue between God who offers his gifts, and the person who is 
called to exercise responsibility, there comes the possibility, indeed the 
necessity, of a total and ongoing formation of the lay faithful, as the Synod 
Fathers have rightly emphasized in much of their work. After having described 
Christian formation as &quot;a continual process in the individual of maturation in 
faith and a likening to Christ, according to the will of the Father, under the 
guidance of the Holy Spirit&quot;, they have clearly affirmed that the formation of 
the lay faithful must be placed<B> </B><I>among the priorities of a diocese. </I>
It ought to be so placed within the <I>plan of pastoral action 
</I>that the efforts of the whole community (clergy, lay faithful and religious) 
converge on this goal&quot;(209).</P>
<P><B><I>To Discover and Live One's Vocation and Mission </I></B></P>
<P>58. The fundamental objective of the formation of the lay faithful is an 
ever-clearer discovery of one's vocation and the ever-greater willingness to 
live it so as to fulfil one's mission.</P>
<P><I>God calls me and sends me forth </I>as a labourer in his vineyard. He 
calls me and sends me forth to work for the coming of his Kingdom in history. 
This personal vocation and mission defines the dignity and the responsibility of 
each member of the lay faithful and makes up the focal point of the whole work 
of formation, whose purpose is the joyous and grateful recognition of this 
dignity and the faithful and generous living-out of this responsibility.</P>
<P>In fact, from eternity God has thought of us and has loved us as unique 
individuals. Every one of us he called by name, as the Good Shepherd &quot;calls his 
sheep by name&quot; (<I>Jn</I> 10:3). However, only in the unfolding of the history 
of our lives and its events is the eternal plan of God revealed to each of us. 
Therefore, it is a gradual process; in a certain sense, one that happens day by 
day.</P>
<P>To be able to discover the actual will of the Lord in our lives always 
involves the following: a receptive listening to the Word of God and the Church, 
fervent and constant prayer, recourse to a wise and loving spiritual guide, and 
a faithful discernment of the gifts and talents given by God, as well as the 
diverse social and historic situations in which one lives.</P>
<P>Therefore, in the life of each member of the lay faithful there are <I>
particularly significant and decisive moments </I>for discerning God's call and 
embracing the mission entrusted by Him. Among these are the periods of <I>
adolescence
</I>and 
<I>young adulthood. </I>No one must forget that the Lord, as the master of the 
labourers in the vineyard, calls <I>at every hour </I>of life so as to make his 
holy will more precisely and explicitly known. Therefore, the fundamental and 
continuous attitude of the disciple should be one of vigilance and a conscious 
attentiveness to the voice of God.</P>
<P>It is not a question of simply <I>knowing </I>what God wants from each of us 
in the various situations of life. The individual must <I>do </I>what God wants, 
as we are reminded in the words that Mary, the Mother of Jesus, addressed to the 
servants at Cana: &quot;Do whatever he tells you&quot; <I>(Jn </I>2:5). However, to act in 
fidelity to God's will requires a <I>capability </I>for acting and <I>the 
developing of that capability. </I>We can rest assured that this is possible 
through the free and responsible collaboration of each of us with the grace of 
the Lord which is never lacking. Saint Leo the Great says: &quot;The one who confers 
the dignity will give the strength!&quot;(210).</P>
<P>This, then, is the marvelous yet demanding task awaiting all the lay faithful 
and all Christians at every moment: to grow always in the knowledge of the 
richness of Baptism and faith as well as to live it more fully. In referring to 
birth and growth as two stages in the Christian life the apostle Peter makes the 
following exhortation: &quot;Like newborn babes, long for the pure spiritual milk, 
that by it you may grow up to salvation&quot; (<I>1</I> <I>Pt
</I>2:2).</P>
<P><B><I>A Total Integrated Formation for Living an Integrated Life </I></B></P>
<P>59. In discovering and living their proper vocation and mission, the lay 
faithful must be formed according to the <I>union </I>which exists from their 
being <I>members of the Church and citizens of human society.</I></P>
<P>There cannot be two parallel lives in their existence: on the one hand, the 
so-called &quot;spiritual&quot; life, with its values and demands; and on the other, the 
so-called &quot;secular&quot; life, that is, life in a family, at work, in social 
relationships, in the responsibilities of public life and in culture. The 
branch, engrafted to the vine which is Christ, bears its fruit in every sphere 
of existence and activity. In fact, every area of the lay faithful's lives, as 
different as they are, enters into the plan of God, who desires that these very 
areas be the &quot;places in time&quot; where the love of Christ is revealed and realized 
for both the glory of the Father and service of others. Every activity, every 
situation, every precise responsibility-as, for example, skill and solidarity in 
work, love and dedication in the family and the education of children, service 
to society and public life and the promotion of truth in the area of culture-are 
the occasions ordained by Providence for a &quot;continuous exercise of faith, hope 
and charity&quot;(211).</P>
<P>The Second Vatican Council has invited all the lay faithful to this <I>unity 
of life </I>by forcefully decrying the grave consequences in separating faith 
from life, and the gospel from culture: &quot;The Council exhorts Christians, as 
citizens of one city and the other, to strive to perform their earthly duties 
faithfully in response to the spirit of the Gospel. They are mistaken who, 
knowing that we have here no abiding city but seek one which is to come, think 
that they may therefore shirk their earthly responsibilities; for they are 
forgetting that by faith itself they are more than ever obliged to measure up to 
these duties, each according to one's vocation ... This split between the faith 
which many profess and their daily lives deserves to be counted among the more 
serious errors of our age&quot;(212).</P>
<P>Therefore, I have maintained that a faith that does not affect a person's 
culture is a faith &quot;not fully embraced, not entirely thought out, not faithfully 
lived&quot;(213).</P>
<P><B><I>Various Aspects of Formation</I></B></P>
<P>60. The many interrelated aspects of a <I>totally integrated formation </I>of 
the lay faithful are situated within this unity of life.</P>
<P>There is no doubt that <I>spiritual </I>formation ought to occupy a 
privileged place in a person's life. Everyone is called to grow continually in 
intimate union with Jesus Christ, in conformity to the Father's will, in 
devotion to others in charity and justice. The Council writes: &quot;This life of 
intimate union with Christ in the Church is nourished by spiritual helps 
available to all the faithful, especially by active participation in the 
liturgy. Lay people should so make use of these helps in such a way that, while 
properly fulfilling their secular duties in the ordinary conditions of life, 
they do not disassociate union with Christ from that life, but through the very 
performance of their tasks according to God's will, may they actually grow in 
it&quot;(214).</P>
<P>The situation today points to an ever-increasing urgency for <I>a doctrinal

</I>formation of the lay faithful, not simply in a better understanding which is 
natural to faith's dynamism but also in enabling them to &quot;give a reason for 
their hoping&quot; in view of the world and its grave and complex problems. 
Therefore, a systematic approach to <I>catechesis, </I>geared to age and the 
diverse situations of life, is an absolute necessity, as is a more decided 
Christian promotion of <I>culture, </I>in response to the perennial yet always 
new questions that concern individuals and society today.</P>
<P>This is especially true for the lay faithful who have responsibilities in 
various fields of society and public life. Above all, it is indispensable that 
they have a more exact knowledge -and this demands a more widespread and precise 
presentation-of the <I>Church's social doctrine, </I>as repeatedly stressed by 
the Synod Fathers in their presentations. They refer to the participation of the 
lay faithful in public life, in the following words: &quot;But for the lay faithful 
to take up actively this noble purpose in political matters, it is not enough to 
exhort them. They must be offered a proper formation of a social conscience, 
especially in the Church's social teaching, which contains principles - of 
reflection, criteria for judging and practical directives (cf. Congregation for 
the Doctrine of the Faith, <I>Instruction of Christian Freedom and Liberation, </I>
72),<I> </I>and which must be present in general catechetical instruction and in 
specialized gatherings, as well as in schools and universities. Nevertheless, 
this social doctrine of the Church is dynamic; that is, adapted to circumstances 
of time and place. It is the right and duty of Pastors to propose moral 
principles even concerning the social order and of all Christians to apply them 
in defence of human rights Nevertheless, active participation in political 
parties is reserved to the lay faithful&quot;(215).</P>
<P>The cultivation of <I>human values </I>finds a place in the context of a 
totally integrated formation, bearing a particular significance for the 
missionary and apostolic activities of the lay faithful. In this regard the 
Council wrote: &quot;(the lay faithful) should also hold in high esteem professional 
skill, family and civic spirit, and the virtues related to social behaviour, 
namely, honesty, a spirit of justice, sincerity, courtesy, moral courage; 
without them there is no true Christian life&quot;(216).</P>
<P>In bringing their lives into an organic synthesis, which is, at one and the 
same time, the manifestation of the unity of &quot;who they are&quot; in the Church and 
society as well as the condition for the effective fulfilment of their mission, 
the lay faithful are to be guided interiorly and sustained by the Holy Spirit, 
who is the Spirit of unity and fullness of life.</P>
<P><B><I>Collaborators with God the Teacher </I></B></P>
<P>61. Where are the lay faithful formed? What are the means of their formation? 
Who are the <I>persons and the communities </I>called upon to assume the task of 
a totally integrated formation of the lay faithful?</P>
<P>Just as the work of human education is intimately connected with fatherhood 
and motherhood, so Christian formation finds its origin and its strength in God 
the Father who loves and educates his children. Yes, <I>God is the first and 
great teacher of his People, </I>as it states in the striking passage of the 
Song of Moses: &quot;He found him in a desert land / and in the howling waste of the 
wilderness; / he encircled him, he cared for him, he kept him as the apple of 
his eye. / Like an eagle that stirs up its nest, that flutters over its young, 
spreading out its wings, catching them, bearing them on its pinions, / the Lord 
alone did lead him, and there was no foreign God with him&quot; <I>(Deut

</I>32:10-12; cf. 8:5).</P>
<P>God's work in forming his people is revealed and fulfilled in Jesus Christ 
the Teacher, and reaches to the depths of every individual's heart as a result 
of the living presence of the Spirit. <I>Mother Church </I>is called to take 
part in the divine work of formation, both through a sharing of her very life, 
and through her various pronouncements and actions. It is thus that the <I>lay 
faithful are formed by the Church and</I><I>in the Church </I>in a mutual 
communion and collaboration of all her members: clergy, religious and lay 
faithful. Thus the whole ecclesial community, in its diverse members, receives 
the fruitfulness of the Spirit and actively cooperates towards that end. With 
this in mind Methodius of Olympo wrote: &quot;Those not yet perfected are carried and 
formed by those more perfect, as in the womb of a mother, until the time they 
are generated and brought forth for the greatness and beauty of virtue&quot;(217). 
This happened with Saint Paul, who was carried and brought forth in the Church 
by those who were perfected (in the person of Ananias) and, then Paul in his 
turn, became perfected and fruitful in bringing forth many children.</P>
<P>First of all the Church is a teacher, in which the Pope takes the &quot;primary&quot; 
role in the formation of the lay faithful. As successor of Saint Peter, he has 
the ministry of &quot;confirming his brothers in the faith&quot;, instructing all 
believers in the essential content of vocation and mission in light of the 
Christian faith and membership in the Church. Therefore, not simply the words 
coming directly from him, but also those transmitted by the various departments 
of the Holy See call for a loving and receptive hearing by the lay faithful.</P>
<P>The one and universal Church is present in various parts of the world, in and 
through the <I>particular Churches. </I>In each of them the Bishop in his person 
has a responsibility towards the lay faithful, in forming the animation and 
guidance of their Christian life through the proclamation of the Word and the 
celebration of the Eucharist and the Sacraments.</P>
<P>Situated and at work within the particular Church or diocese is the <I>Parish

</I>which has the essential task of a more personal and immediate formation of 
the lay faithful. In fact, because it is in the position to reach more easily 
individual persons and singular groups, the parish is called to instruct its 
members in hearing God's Word, in liturgical and personal dialogue with God, in 
the life of fraternal charity, and in allowing a more direct and concrete 
perception of the sense of ecclesial communion and responsibility in the 
Church's mission.</P>
<P>Internal to the parish, especially if vast and territorially extensive, <I>
small Church communities, </I>where present, can be a notable help in the 
formation of Christians, by providing a consciousness and an experience of 
ecclesial communion and mission which are more extensive and incisive. The Synod 
Fathers have said that a post-baptismal catechesis in the form of a 
catechumenate can also be helpful by presenting again some elements from the 
Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults with the purpose of allowing a person to 
grasp and live the immense, extraordinary richness and responsibility received 
at Baptism(218).</P>
<P>In the formation that the lay faithful receive from their diocese and parish, 
especially concerning communion and mission, the help that diverse members of 
the Church can give to each other is particularly important. This mutual help 
also aids in revealing the mystery of the Church as Mother and Teacher. Priests 
and religious ought to assist the lay faithful in their formation. In this 
regard the Synod Fathers have invited priests and candidates for Orders to &quot;be 
prepared carefully so that they are ready to foster the vocation and mission of 
the lay faithful&quot;(219). In turn, the lay faithful themselves can and should help 
priests and religious in the course of their spiritual and pastoral journey.</P>
<P><B><I>Other Places for Formation</I></B></P>
<P>62 . The <I>Christian family, </I>as the &quot;domestic Church&quot;, also makes up a 
natural and fundamental school for formation in the faith: father and mother 
receive from the Sacrament of Matrimony the grace and the ministry of the 
Christian education of their children, before whom they bear witness and to whom 
they transmit both human and religious values. While learning their first words, 
children learn also the praise of God, whom they feel is near them as a loving 
and providential Father; while learning the first acts of love, children also 
learn to open themselves to others, and through the gift of self receive the 
sense of living as a human being. The daily life itself of a truly Christian 
family makes up the first &quot;experience of Church&quot;, intended to find confirmation 
and development in an active and responsible process of the children's 
introduction into the wider ecclesial community and civil society. The more that 
Christian spouses and parents grow in the awareness that their &quot;domestic church&quot; 
participates in the life and mission of the universal Church, so much the more 
will their sons and daughters be able to be formed in a &quot;sense of the Church&quot; 
and will perceive all the beauty of dedicating their energies to the service of 
the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P><I>Schools and Catholic universities, </I>as well as centers of spiritual 
renewal which are becoming ever more widespread in these days, are also 
important places for formation. In the present social and historical context 
which is marked by an extensively deep cultural involvement, the Synod Fathers 
have emphasized that parents' participation in school life-besides being always 
necessary and without substitution-is no longer enough. What is needed is to 
prepare the lay faithful to dedicate themselves to the work of rearing their 
children as a true and proper part of Church mission. What is needed is to 
constitute and develop this &quot;formation community&quot; which is together comprised of 
parents, teachers, clergy, women and men religious and representatives of youth. 
In order that the school can suitably fulfill its natural function in formation, 
the lay faithful ought to feel charged to demand from everyone and for everyone 
a true freedom in education, even through opportune civil legislation(220).</P>
<P>The Synod Fathers expressed words of esteem and encouragement to all those 
lay faithful, both women and men, who with a civic and Christian spirit, fulfill 
a task which is involved in the education of children both in schools and 
institutes of formation. In addition they have emphasized the urgent need in 
various schools, whether Catholic or not, for teachers and professors among the 
lay faithful to be true witnesses of the gospel, through their example of life, 
their professional competence and uprightness, their Christian inspired 
teaching, preserving always-as is obvious-the autonomy of various sciences and 
disciplines. It is of singular importance that scientific and technological 
research done by the faithful be correct from the standpoint of service to an 
individual in the totality of the context of one's values and needs: to these 
lay faithful the Church entrusts the task of allowing all to better understand 
the intimate bond that exists between faith and science, between the gospel and 
human culture(221).</P>
<P>&quot;This Synod&quot;-we read in the proposition-&quot;appeals to the prophetic task of 
Catholic schools and universities, and praises teachers and professors, now lay 
people for the most part, for their dedication to maintaining institutes of 
Catholic education that can form men and women in whom the new commandment is 
enfleshed. The simultaneous presence of clergy, the lay faithful and men and 
women religious, offers students a vivid image of the Church and makes 
recognition of its riches easier (cf. <I>Congregation for Catholic Education, </I>
Concerning the Lay Educator, Witness of Faith in the Schools)&quot;(222).</P>
<P><I>Groups, associations and movements </I>also have their place in the 
formation of the lay faithful. In fact they have the possibility, each with its 
own method, of oflfering a formation through a deeply shared experience in the 
apostolic life, as well as having the opportunity to integrate, to make concrete 
and specific the formation that their members receive from other persons and 
communities.</P>
<P><B><I>The Reciprocal Formation Received and Given by All</I></B> </P>
<P>63. Formation is not the privilege of a few, but a right and duty of all. In 
this regard the Synod Fathers have said: &quot;Possibilities of formation should be 
proposed to all, especially the poor, who can also be a source of formation for 
all&quot;; and they added: &quot;Suitable means to help each person fulfill a full, human 
and Christian vocation should be applied to formation&quot;(223).</P>
<P>For the purpose of a truly incisive and effective pastoral activity the <I>
formation of those who will form others is </I>to be developed through 
appropriate courses or suitable schools. Forming those who, in turn, will be 
given the responsibility for the formation of the lay faithful, constitutes a 
basic requirement of assuring the general and widespread formation of all the 
lay faithful.</P>
<P>According to the explicit invitation of the Synod Fathers special attention 
ought to be devoted to the local culture in the work of formation: &quot;The 
formation of Christians will take the greatest account of local human culture, 
which contributes to formation itself, and will help to discern the value, 
whether implanted in tradition or proposed in modern affairs. Attention should 
be paid to diverse cultures which can exist in one and the same people or nation 
at the same time. The Church, the mother and teacher of peoples, should strive 
to safeguard, where the need exists, the culture of a less numerous people 
living in large nations when the situation exists&quot;(224).</P>
<P>In the work of formation some convictions reveal themselves as particularly 
necessary and fruitful. First of all, there is the conviction that one cannot 
offer a true and effective formation to others if the individual has not taken 
on or developed a personal responsibility for formation: this, in fact, is 
essentially a &quot;formation of self&quot;.</P>
<P>In addition, there is the conviction that at one and the same time each of us 
is the goal and principle of formation: the more we are formed and the more we 
feel the need to pursue and deepen our formation, still more will we be formed 
and be rendered capable of forming others.</P>
<P>It is particularly important to know that the work of formation, while having 
intelligent recourse to the means and methods available from human science, is 
made more effective the more it is open to the <I>action of God. 
</I>Only the branch which does not fear being pruned by the heavenly vinedresser 
can bear much fruit for the individual and for others.</P>
<P><B><I>An Appeal and A Prayer</I></B> </P>
<P>64. At the conclusion of this post-Synodal document I once again put forward 
the invitation of &quot;the householder&quot;, proposed in the gospel: <I>You go into my 
vineyard too. </I>It can be said that the significance of the Synod on the 
vocation and mission of the lay faithful might very well consist in this

<I>call of the Lord which he addresses to eueryone, </I>yet, in a particular way 
to the lay faithful, both women and men.</P>
<P>The happenings at the Synod have been a great spiritual experience for all 
the participants. The experience has been that of a Church under the light and 
the power of the Spirit, intent on discerning and embracing the renewed call of 
her Lord so that she can again propose to today's world, the mystery of her 
communion and the dynamism of her mission of salvation, especially, by centering 
on the specific place and role of the lay faithful. This Exhortation, then, 
intends to urge the most abundant possible fruitfulness from this Synod in every 
part of the Church worldwide. This will come about as a result of an effective 
hearkening to the Lord's call by the entire People of God, in particular, by the 
lay faithful.</P>
<P>Therefore I make a strong appeal to one and all, Pastors and faithful, never 
to become tired of maintaining-indeed always taking an active part to fix deeply 
in one's mind, heart and life-an <I>ecclesial consciousness, </I>which is ever 
mindful of what it means to be members of the Church of Jesus Christ, 
participants in her mystery of communion and in her dynamism in mission and the 
apostolate.</P>
<P>It is of particular importance that all Christians be aware that through 
Baptism they have received an <I>extraordinary dignity: </I>through grace we are 
called to be children loved by the Father, members incorporated in Christ and 
his Church, living and holy temples of the Spirit. With deep emotion and 
gratitude, we again hear the words of John the Evangelist: &quot;See what love the 
Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are&quot; (<I>1 
Jn </I>3:1).</P>
<P>While this &quot;Christian <I>newness of life&quot; </I>given to the members of the 
Church, constitutes for all the basis of their participation in the priestly, 
prophetic and kingly mission of Christ and of their vocation to holines in love, 
it receives expression and is fulfilled in the lay faithful through the &quot;secular 
character&quot; which is &quot;uniquely and properly&quot; theirs.</P>
<P>Besides imparting an awareness of a commonly shared Christian dignity, an 
ecclesial consciousness brings a sense of belonging to <I>the mystery of the 
Church as Communion. </I>This is a basic and undeniable aspect of the life and 
mission of the Church. For one and all the earnest prayer of Jesus at the Last 
Supper, <I>&quot;That all may be one&quot; (Jn </I>17-21), ought to become daily a 
required and undeniable programme of life and action.</P>
<P>A real sense of Church communion, the gift of the Spirit that urges our free 
and generous response, will bring forth as its precious fruit, in the &quot;one and 
catholic&quot; Church the continuing value of the rich variety of vocations and 
conditions of life, charisms, ministries, works, and responsibilities, as well 
as a more demonstrable and decisive collaboration of groups, associations and 
movements of the lay faithful in keeping with the accomplishment of the commonly 
shared salvific mission of the Church herself. This communion is already in 
itself the first great sign in the world of the presence of Christ, the Saviour. 
At the same time, it promotes and stimulates the proper apostolic and missionary 
action of the Church.</P>
<P>The whole Church, Pastors and lay faithful alike, standing on the threshold 
of the Third Millennium, ought to feel more strong]y the Church's responsibility 
to obey the command of Christ, &quot;Go into all the world and preach the gospel to 
the whole creation&quot; <I>(Mk </I>16:15), and take up anew the missionary 
endeavour. A great venture, both challenging and wonderful, is entrusted to the 
Church-that of a <I>re-evangelization, </I>which is so much needed by the 
present world. The lay faithful ought to regard themselves as an active and 
responsible part of thisventure, called as they are to proclaim and to live the 
gospel in service to the person and to society while respecting the totality of 
the values and needs of both.</P>
<P>Since the Synod of Bishops was celebrated last October during the Marian 
Year, its work was entrusted in a very special way to the intercession of the 
Most Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of the Redeemer. I too entrust the spiritual 
fruitfulness of the Synod to her prayerful intercession. Therefore, along with 
the Synod Fathers, the lay faithful present at the Synod and all the other 
members of the People of God, I have recourse at the end of this post-Synodal 
document to the Virgin Mary. At this moment this appeal becomes a prayer:</P>
<P><a name="O_Most_Blessed">O Most Blessed</a> Virgin Mary,<BR>Mother of Christ 
and Mother of the Church, With joy and wonder we seek to make our own your <I>
Magnificat, </I>joining you in your hymn of thankfulness and love.<BR></P>
<P>With you we give thanks to God,<BR>&quot;whose mercy<BR>is from generation to 
generation&quot;,<BR>for the exalted vocation<BR>and the many forms of mission<BR>
entrusted to the lay faithful.</P>
<P><BR>God has called each of them by name<BR>to live his own communion of love<BR>
and holiness<BR>and to be one<BR>in the great family of God's children.<BR>He 
has sent them forth<BR>to shine with the light of Christ<BR>and to communicate 
the fire of the Spirit<BR>in every part of society<BR>through their life<BR>
inspired by the gospel.</P>
<P><BR>O Virgin of the <I>Magnificat,</I><BR>fill their hearts<BR>with a 
gratitude and enthusiasm<BR>for this vocation and mission.</P>
<P><BR>With humility and magnanimity<BR>you were the &quot;handmaid of the Lord&quot;;<BR>
give us your unreserved willingness<BR>for service to God<BR>and the salvation 
of the world.<BR>Open our hearts<BR>to the great anticipation<BR>of the Kingdom 
of God<BR>and of the proclamation of the Gospel<BR>to the whole of creation.<BR>
Your mother's heart<BR>is ever mindful of the many dangers<BR>and evils which 
threaten<BR>to overpower men and women<BR>in our time.</P>
<P><BR>At the same time your heart also takes notice<BR>of the many initiatives<BR>
undertaken for good,<BR>the great yearning for values,<BR>and the progress 
achieved<BR>in bringing forth<BR>the abundant fruits of salvation.</P>
<P><BR>O Virgin full of courage,<BR>may your spiritual strength<BR>and trust in 
God inspire us,<BR>so that we might know<BR>how to overcome all the obstacles<BR>
that we encounter<BR>in accomplishing our mission.<BR>Teach us to treat the 
affairs<BR>of the world<BR>with a real sense of Christian responsibility<BR>and 
a joyful hope<BR>of the coming of God's Kingdom, and<BR>of a &quot;new heaven and a 
new earth&quot;.</P>
<P><BR>You who were gathered in prayer<BR>with the Apostles in the Cenacle,<BR>
awaiting the coming<BR>of the Spirit at Pentecost,<BR>implore his renewed 
outpouring<BR>on all the faithful, men and women alike,<BR>so that they might 
more fully respond<BR>to their vocation and mission,<BR>as branches engrafted to 
the true vine,<BR>called to bear much fruit<BR>for the life of the world.</P>
<P><BR>O Virgin Mother,<BR>guide and sustain us<BR>so that we might always live<BR>
as true sons and daughters<BR>of the Church of your Son.<BR>Enable us to do our 
part<BR>in helping to establish on earth<BR>the civilization of truth and love,<BR>
as God wills it,<BR>for his glory.<BR></P>
<P>Amen</P>
<P><I>Given at Rome, in St. Peter's, on 30 December, the Feast of the Holy 
Family of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, in the year 1988, the eleventh of my 
Pontificate.</I></P>
