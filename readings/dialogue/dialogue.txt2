         INTRODUCTION 
         
         It would be hard to say whether the Age of the Saints,  le moyen
        age enorme et delicat , has suffered more at the hands of friends or
        foes. It is at least certain that the medieval period affects those who
        approach it in the manner of a powerful personality who may awaken love
        or hatred, but cannot be passed over with indifference. When the
        contempt of the eighteenth century for the subject, the result of that
        century's lack of historic imagination, was thawed by the somewhat
        rhetorical enthusiasm of Chateaubriand and of the Romanticists beyond
        the Rhine, hostility gave place to an undiscriminating admiration. The
        shadows fell out of the picture; the medieval time became a golden age
        when heaven and earth visibly mingled, when Christian society reached
        the zenith of perfection which constituted it a model for all succeeding
        ages. Then came the German professors with all the paraphernalia of
        scientific history, and, looking through their instruments, we, who are
        not Germans, have come to take a more critical and, perhaps, a juster
        view of the matter. The Germans, too, have had disciples of other
        nations, and though conclusions on special points may differ, in every
        country now at a certain level of education, the same views prevail as
        to the principles on which historical investigation should be conducted.
        And yet, while no one with a reputation to lose would venture on any
        personal heresy as to the standards of legitimate evidence, the same
        facts still seem to lead different minds to differing appreciations. For
        history, written solely  ad narrandum , is not history; the
        historian's task is not over when he has disinterred facts and
        established dates: it is then that the most delicate part of his work
        begins. History, to be worthy of the name, must produce the illusion of
        living men and women, and, in order to do this successfully, must be
        based, not only upon insight into human nature in general, but also upon
        personal appreciation of the particular men and women engaged in the
        episodes with which it deals. With facts as such, there can indeed be no
        tampering; but for the determination of their significance, of their
        value, as illustrative of a course of policy or of the character of
        those who were responsible for their occurrence, we have to depend in
        great measure on the personality of the historian. It is evident that a
        man who lacks the sympathetic power to enter into the character that he
        attempts to delineate, will hardly be able to make that character live
        for us. For in Art as well as Life, sympathy is power. 
         Now, while this is true of all history whatever, it is perhaps truer
        of the history of the middle ages than of that of any more recent
        period, nor is the reason of this far to seek. The middle ages were a
        period fruitful in great individuals who molded society, to an extent
        that perhaps no succeeding period has been. In modern times the formula,
        an abstraction such as "Capital" or the "Rights of
        Man" has largely taken the place of the individual as a plastic
        force. The one great Tyrant of the nineteenth century found his
        opportunity in the anarchy which followed the French Revolution. The
        spoil was then necessarily to the strong. But even Napoleon was
        conquered at last rather by a conspiracy of the slowly developing
        anonymous forces of his time than by the superior skill or strength of
        an individual rival. The lion could hardly have been caught in such
        meshes in the trecento. Then, the fate of populations was bound up with
        the animosities of princes, and, in order to understand the state of
        Europe at any particular moment of that period, it is necessary to
        understand the state of soul of the individuals who happened, at the
        time, to be the political stakeholders. 
         It must not be thought, however, that the personality of the prince
        was the only power in the medieval state, for the prince himself was
        held to be ultimately amenable to an idea, which so infinitely
        transcended earthly distinctions as to level them all in relation to
        itself. Religion was in those days a mental and social force which we,
        in spite of the petulant acerbity of modern theological controversies,
        have difficulty in realizing. Prince and serf would one day appear as
        suppliants before the Judgment- seat of Christ, and the theory of
        medieval Christianity was considerably in favor of the serf. The Father
        of Christendom, at once Priest and King, anointed and consecrated as the
        social exponent of the Divine Justice, could not, in his own person,
        escape its rigors, but must, one day, render an account of his
        stewardship. Nor did the medieval mind, distinguishing between the
        office and the individual, by any means shrink from contemplating the
        fate of the faithless steward. In a "Last Judgment" by
        Angelico at Florence, the ministers of justice seem to have a special
        joy in hurrying off to the pit popes and cardinals and other
        ecclesiastics. 
         For it is an insufficient criticism that has led some to suppose that
        the medieval Church weighed on the conscience of Christendom solely, or
        even primarily, as an arbitrary fact: that the priesthood, aided by the
        ignorance of the people, succeeded in establishing a monstrous claim to
        control the destinies of the soul by quasi-magical agencies and the
        powers of excommunication. Nothing can be further from the truth.
        Probably at no period has the Christian conscience realized more
        profoundly that the whole external fabric of Catholicism, its
        sacraments, its priesthood, its discipline, was but the phenomenal
        expression, necessary and sacred in its place, of the Idea of
        Christianity, that the vitality of that Idea was the life by which the
        Church lived, and that by that Idea all Christians, priests as well as
        laymen, rulers as well as subjects, would at the last be judged. When
        Savonarola replied to the Papal Legate, who, in his confusion, committed
        the blunder of adding to the formula of excommunication from the Church
        Militant, a sentence of exclusion from the Church Triumphant, "You
        cannot do it," he was in the tradition of medieval orthodoxy.
        Moreover, even though the strict logic of her theory might have required
        it, the hierarchical Church was not considered as the sole manifestation
        of the Divine Will to Christendom. The unanimity with which the
        Christian idea was accepted in those times made the saint a well-known
        type of human character just as nowadays we have the millionaire or the
        philanthropist. Now the saint, although under the same ecclesiastical
        dispensation as other Christians, was conceived to have his own special
        relations with God, which amounted almost to a personal revelation. In
        particular he was held to be exempt from many of the limitations of
        fallen humanity. His prayers were of certain efficacy; the customary
        uniformities of experience were thought to be constantly transcended by
        the power that dwelt within him; he was often accepted by the people as
        the bearer to Christendom of a Divine message over and above the
        revelation of which the hierarchy was the legitimate guardian. Not
        infrequently indeed that message was one of warning or correction to the
        hierarchy. Sabatier points out truly that the medieval saints occupied
        much the same relation to the ecclesiastical system as the Prophets of
        Israel had done, under the older dispensation, to the Jewish Priesthood.
        They came out of their hermitages or cloisters, and with lips touched by
        coal from the altar denounced iniquity wherever they found it, even in
        the highest places. It is needless to say that they were not
        revolutionaries -- had they been so indeed the state of Europe might
        have been very different today; for them, as for other Christians, the
        organization of the Church was Divine; it was by the sacred
        responsibilities of his office that they judged the unworthy pastor. 
         An apt illustration of this attitude occurs in the life of the
        Blessed Colomba of Rieti. Colomba, who was a simple peasant, was called
        to the unusual vocation of preaching. The local representatives of the
        Holy Office, alarmed at the novelty, imprisoned her and took the
        opportunity of a visit of Alexander VI. to the neighboring town of
        Perugia to bring her before his Holiness for examination. When the saint
        was brought into the Pope's presence, she reverently kissed the hem of
        his garment, and, being overcome with devotion at the sight of the Vicar
        of Christ, fell into an ecstasy, during which she invoked the Divine
        judgment on the sins of Rodrigo Borgia. It was useless to attempt to
        stop her; she was beyond the control of inquisitor or guards; the Pope
        had to hear her out. He did so; proclaimed her complete orthodoxy, and
        set her free with every mark of reverence. In this highly characteristic
        episode scholastic logic appears, for once, to have been justified, at
        perilous odds, of her children. . . . 
         * * * 
         Midway between sky and earth hangs a City Beautiful: Siena, Vetus
        Civitas Virginis. The town seems to have descended as a bride from airy
        regions, and lightly settled on the summits of three hills which it
        crowns with domes and clustering towers. As seen from the vineyards
        which clothe the slopes of the hills or with its crenellated wall and
        slender-necked Campanile silhouetted against the evening sky from the
        neighboring heights of Belcaro, the city is familiar to students of the
        early Italian painters. It forms the fantastic and solemn background of
        many a masterpiece of the trecentisti, and seems the only possible home,
        if home they can have on earth, of the glorified persons who occupy the
        foreground. It would create no surprise to come, while walking round the
        ancient walls, suddenly, at a turn in the road, on one of the sacred
        groups so familiarly recurrent to the memory in such an environment:
        often indeed one experiences a curious illusion when a passing friar
        happens for a moment to "compose" with cypress and crumbling
        archway. 
         Siena, once the successful rival of Florence in commerce, war, and
        politics, has, fortunately for the more vital interests which it
        represents, long desisted from such minor matters. Its worldly ruin has
        been complete for more than five hundred years; in truth the town has
        never recovered from the plague which, in the far-off days of 1348,
        carried off 80,000 of its population. Grassy mounds within the city
        walls mark the shrinking of the town since the date of their erection,
        and Mr. Murray gives its present population at less than 23,000. The
        free Ghibelline Republic which, on that memorable 4th of September 1260,
        defeated, with the help of Pisa, at Monte Aperto, the combined forces of
        the Guelf party in Tuscany, has now, after centuries of servitude to
        Spaniard and Austrian, to be content with the somewhat pinchbeck dignity
        of an Italian Prefettura. At least the architectural degradation which
        has overtaken Florence at the hands of her modern rulers has been as
        yet, in great measure, spared to Siena. Even the railway has had the
        grace to conceal its presence in the folds of olive which enwrap the
        base of the hill on which the city is set. 
         Once inside the rose-colored walls, as we pass up the narrow, roughly
        paved streets between lines of palaces, some grim and massive like Casa
        Tolomei, built in 1205, others delicate specimens of Italian Gothic like
        the Palazzo Saracini, others again illustrating the combination of grace
        and strength which marked the domestic architecture of the Renaissance
        at its prime, like the Palazzo Piccolomini, we find ourselves in a world
        very remote indeed from anything with which the experience of our own
        utilitarian century makes us familiar. And yet, as we rub our eyes,
        unmistakably a world of facts, though of facts, as it were, visibly
        interpreted by the deeper truth of an art whose insistent presence is on
        all sides of us. Here is Casa Tolomei, a huge cube of rough-hewn stone
        stained to the color of tarnished silver with age, once the home of that
        Madonna Pia whose story lives forever in the verse of Dante. Who shall
        distinguish between her actual tale of days and the immortal life given
        her by the poet? In her moment of suffering at least she has been made
        eternal. And not far from that ancient fortress-home, in a winding alley
        that can hardly be called a street, is another house of medieval Siena
        -- no palace this time, but a small tradesman's dwelling. In the
        fourteenth century it belonged to Set Giacomo Benincasa, a dyer. Part of
        it has now been converted into a chapel, over the door of which are
        inscribed the words: Sponsae Xti Katerinae Domus. Here, on March 5,
        1347, being Palm Sunday, was born Giacomo's daughter Caterina, who still
        lives one of the purest glories of the Christian Church under the name
        of St. Catherine of Siena. More than 500 years have passed since the
        daughter of the Siennese dyer entered into the rest of that sublime and
        touching symbolism under which the Church half veils and half reveals
        her teaching as to the destiny of man. Another case, but how profoundly
        more significant than that of poor Madonna Pia, of the intertwining of
        the world of fact with the deeper truth of art. 
         St. Catherine was born at the same time as a twin-sister, who did not
        survive. Her parents, Giacomo and Lapa Benincasa, were simple
        townspeople, prosperous, and apparently deserving their reputation for
        piety. Lapa, the daughter of one Mucio Piagenti, a now wholly forgotten
        poet, bore twenty-five children to her husband, of whom thirteen only
        appear to have grown up. This large family lived together in the manner
        still obtaining in Italy, in the little house, till the death of Giacomo
        in 1368. 
         There are stirring pages enough in Christian hagiology. Who can read
        unmoved of the struggles towards his ideal of an Augustine or a Loyola,
        or of the heroic courage of a Theresa, affirming against all human odds
        the divinity of her mission, and justifying, after years of labor, her
        incredible assertions by the steadfastness of her will? There are other
        pages in the lives of the saints, less dramatic, it may be, but
        breathing, nevertheless, a na•ve grace and poetry all their own: the
        childhood of those servants of Christ who have borne His yoke from the
        dawn of their days forms their charming theme. Here the blasting
        illuminations of the Revelation are toned down to a soft and tender
        glow, in which the curves and lines of natural humanity do but seem more
        pathetically human. The hymn at Lauds for the Feast of the Holy
        Innocents represents those unconscious martyrs as playing with their
        palms and crowns under the very altar of Heaven: -- 
          "Vos prima Christi victima 
        Grex immolatorum tener 
        Aram sub ipsam simplices 
        Palma et coronis luditis!"  
         And so these other saintly babies play at hermits or monasteries
        instead of the soldiers and housekeeping beloved of more secular-minded
        infants. Heaven condescends to their pious revels: we are told of the
        Blessed Hermann Joseph, the Premonstratensian, that his infantile sports
        were joyously shared by the Divine Child Himself. He would be a morose
        pedant indeed who should wish to rationalize this white mythology. The
        tiny Catherine was no exception to the rest of her canonized brothers
        and sisters. At the age of five it was her custom on the staircase to
        kneel and repeat a "Hail Mary" at each step, a devotion so
        pleasing to the angels, that they would frequently carry her up or down
        without letting her feet touch the ground, much to the alarm of her
        mother, who confided to Father Raymond of Capua, the Dominican confessor
        of the family, her fears of an accident. Nor were these phenomena the
        only reward of her infant piety. From the day that she could walk she
        became very popular among her numerous relatives and her parents'
        friends, who gave her the pet name of Euphrosyne, to signify the
        grief-dispelling effect of her conversation, and who were constantly
        inviting her to their houses on some pretext or other. Sent one morning
        on an errand to the house of her married sister Bonaventura, she was
        favored with a beautiful vision which, as it has an important symbolical
        bearing on the great task of her after-life, I will relate in Father
        Raymond's words, slightly abridging their prolixity. 
         "So it happened that Catherine, being arrived at the age of six,
        went one day with her brother Stephen, who was a little older than
        herself, to the house of their sister Bonaventura, who was married to
        one Niccol", as has been mentioned above, in order to carry
        something or give some message from their mother Lapa. Their mother's
        errand accomplished, while they were on the way back from their sister's
        house to their own and were passing along a certain valley, called by
        the people Valle Piatta, the holy child, lifting her eyes, saw on the
        opposite side above the Church of the Preaching Friars a most beautiful
        room, adorned with regal magnificence, in which was seated, on an
        imperial throne, Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, clothed in
        pontifical vestments, and wearing on His head a papal tiara; with Him
        were the princes of the Apostles, Peter and Paul, and the holy
        evangelist John. Astounded at such a sight, Catherine stood still, and
        with fixed and immovable look, gazed, full of love, on her Savior, who,
        appearing in so marvelous a manner, in order sweetly to gain her love to
        Himself, fixed on her the eyes of His Majesty, and, with a tender smile,
        lifted over her His right hand, and, making the sign of the Holy Cross
        in the manner of a bishop, left with her the gift of His eternal
        benediction. The grace of this gift was so efficacious, that Catherine,
        beside herself, and transformed into Him upon whom she gazed with such
        love, forgetting not only the road she was on, but also herself,
        although naturally a timid child, stood still for a space with lifted
        and immovable eyes in the public road, where men and beasts were
        continually passing, and would certainly have continued to stand there
        as long as the vision lasted, had she not been violently diverted by
        others. But while the Lord was working these marvels, the child Stephen,
        leaving her standing still, continued his way down hill, thinking that
        she was following, but, seeing her immovable in the distance and paying
        no heed to his calls, he returned and pulled her with his hands, saying:
        'What are you doing here? why do you not come?' Then Catherine, as if
        waking from a heavy sleep, lowered her eyes and said: 'Oh, if you had
        seen what I see, you would not distract me from so sweet a vision!' and
        lifted her eyes again on high; but the vision had entirely disappeared,
        according to the will of Him who had granted it, and she, not being able
        to endure this without pain, began with tears to reproach herself for
        having turned her eyes to earth." Such was the "call" of
        St. Catherine of Siena, and, to a mind intent on mystical significance,
        the appearance of Christ, in the semblance of His Vicar, may fitly
        appear to symbolize the great mission of her after-life to the Holy See. 
         * * * 
         &nbsp; 
         Much might be said of the action of Catherine on her generation. Few
        individuals perhaps have ever led so active a life or have succeeded in
        leaving so remarkable an imprint of their personality on the events of
        their time. Catherine the Peacemaker reconciles warring factions of her
        native city and heals an international feud between Florence and the
        Holy See. Catherine the Consoler pours the balm of her gentle spirit
        into the lacerated souls of the suffering wherever she finds them, in
        the condemned cell or in the hospital ward. She is one of the most
        voluminous of letter-writers, keeping up a constant correspondence with
        a band of disciples, male and female, all over Italy, and last, but not
        least, with the distant Pope at Avignon. 
         Her lot was cast on evil days for the Church and the Peninsula. The
        trecento, the apogee of the middle ages was over. Francis and Dominic
        had come and gone, and though Franciscans and Dominicans remained and
        numbered saints among their ranks, still the first fervor of the
        original inspiration was a brightness that had fled. The moral state of
        the secular clergy was, according to Catherine herself, too often one of
        the deepest degradation, while, in the absence of the Pontiff, the
        States of the Church were governed by papal legates, mostly men of blood
        and lust, who ground the starving people under their heel. Assuredly it
        was not from Christian bishops who would have disgraced Islam that their
        subjects could learn the path of peace. The Pope's residence at Avignon,
        the Babylonish Captivity, as it was called, may have seemed, at the time
        when his departure from Rome was resolved upon, a wise measure of
        temporary retreat before the anarchy which was raging round the city of
        St. Peter. But not many years passed before it became evident that
        Philip the Fair, the astute adviser to whose counsel -- and possibly
        more than counsel -- Clement had submitted in leaving Rome, was the only
        one who profited by the exile of the Pope. Whatever the truth may be
        about the details of Clement's election, so far as his subservience to
        the French king went, he might have remained Archbishop of Bordeaux to
        the end of his days. He accepted for his relations costly presents from
        Philip; he placed the papal authority at his service in the gravely
        suspicious matter of the suppression of the Templars. Gradually the Holy
        See in exile lost its ecumenical character and became more and more the
        vassal of the French crown. Such a decline in its position could not
        fail to affect even its doctrinal prestige. It was well enough in theory
        to apply to the situation such maxims as Ubi Petrus ibi Ecclesia, or, as
        the Avignonese doctors paraphrased it, Ubi Papa ibi Roma; but, in
        practice, Christendom grew shy of a French Pope, living under the eye
        and power of the French king. The Romans, who had always treated the
        Pope badly, were furious when at last they had driven him away, and
        gratified their spite by insulting their exiled rulers. Nothing could
        exceed their contempt for the Popes of Avignon, who, as a matter of
        fact, though weak and compliant, were in their personal characters
        worthy ecclesiastics. They gave no credit to John XXII. for his genuine
        zeal in the cause of learning, or the energy with which he restored
        ecclesiastical studies in the Western Schools. For Benedict XII., a
        retiring and abstemious student, they invented the phrase: bibere
        papaliter -- to drink like the Pope. Clement VI. they called  poco
        religioso , forgetting his noble charity at the time of the plague,
        and also the fact that Rome herself had produced not a few popes whose
        lives furnished a singular commentary on the ethics of the Gospel. 
         The real danger ahead to Christendom was the possibility of an
        Italian anti-Pope who should fortify his position by recourse to the
        heretical elements scattered through the peninsula. Those elements were
        grave and numerous. The Fraticelli or Spiritual Franciscans, although
        crushed for the time by the iron hand of Pope Boniface, rather
        flourished than otherwise under persecution. These dangerous heretics
        had inherited a garbled version of the mysticism of Joachim of Flora,
        which constituted a doctrine perhaps more radically revolutionary than
        that of any heretics before or since. It amounted to belief in a new
        revelation of the Spirit, which was to supersede the dispensation of the
        Son as that had taken the place of the dispensation of the Father.
        According to the Eternal Gospel of Gerard of San Domino, who had derived
        it, not without much adroit manipulation, from the writings of Abbot
        Joachim, the Roman Church was on the eve of destruction, and it was the
        duty of the Spirituali, the saints who had received the new
        dispensation, to fly from the contamination of her communion. An
        anti-Pope who should have rallied to his allegiance these elements of
        schism would have been a dangerous rival to a French Pope residing in
        distant Avignon, however legitimate his title. Nor was there wanting
        outside Italy matter for grave anxiety. Germs of heresy were fermenting
        north of the Alps; the preaching of Wycliffe, the semi-Islamism of the
        Hungarian Beghards, the Theism of the Patarini of Dalmatia, the erotic
        mysticism of the Adamites of Paris, indicated a widespread anarchy in
        the minds of Christians. Moreover, the spiritual difficulties of the
        Pope were complicated by his temporal preoccupations. For good or ill,
        it had come to be essential to the action of the Holy See that the
        successor of the penniless fisherman should have his place among the
        princes of the earth. 
         The papal monarchy had come about, as most things come about in this
        world, by what seems to have been the inevitable force of circumstances.
        The decay of the Imperial power in Italy due to the practical
        abandonment of the Western Empire -- for the ruler of Constantinople
        lived at too great a distance to be an effective Emperor of the West --
        had resulted in a natural increase of secular importance to the See of
        Rome. To the genius of Pope Gregory I., one of the few men whom their
        fellows have named both Saint and Great, was due the development of the
        political situation thus created in Italy. 
         Chief and greatest of bishops in his day was St. Gregory the Great.
        Seldom, if ever, has the papal dignity been sustained with such lofty
        enthusiasm, such sagacious political insight. Himself a Roman of Rome,  Romano
        di Roma , as those who possess that privilege still call themselves
        today, the instinct of government was his by hereditary right. He had
        the defects as well as the qualities of the statesman. His theological
        writings, which are voluminous and verbose, are marked rather by a sort
        of canonized common sense than by exalted flights of spirituality. His
        missionary enterprise was characterized by a shrewd and gracious
        condescension to the limitations of human nature. Thus he counsels St.
        Augustine, who had consulted him as to the best means of extirpating the
        pagan customs of our English forefathers, to deal gently with these
        ancient survivals. He ruled that the celebration of the Festivals of the
        Sabots should if possible be held at the times and places at which the
        people had been in the habit of meeting together to worship the gods.
        They would thus come to associate the new religion with their
        traditional merry-makings, and their conversion would be gradually, and
        as it were unconsciously, effected. It was a kindly and statesmanlike
        thought. In this way Gregory may truly be looked upon as the founder of
        popular Catholicism, that "pensive use and wont religion," not
        assuredly in the entirety of its details Christian, but at least
        profoundly Catholic, as weaving together in the web of its own secular
        experience of man so large a proportion of the many-colored threads that
        have at any time attached his hopes and fears to the mysterious unknown
        which surrounds him. No miracle is needed to explain the political
        ascendancy which such a man inevitably came to acquire in an Italy
        deserted by the Empire, and, but for him and the organization which
        depended on him, at the mercy of the invading Lombard. More and more,
        people came to look on the Pope as their temporal ruler no less than as
        their spiritual father. In many cases, indeed, his was the only
        government they knew. Kings and nobles had conferred much property on
        the Roman Church. By the end of the sixth century the Bishop of Rome
        held, by the right of such donations to his See, large tracts of
        country, not only in Italy, but also in Sicily, Corsica, Gaul, and even
        Asia and Africa. Gregory successfully defended his Italian property
        against the invaders, and came to the relief of the starving population
        with corn from Sicily and Africa, thus laying deep in the hearts of the
        people the foundations of the secular power of the Papacy. 
         It would be an unnecessary digression from our subject to work out in
        detail the stages by which the Pope came to take his place first as the
        Italian vicar of a distant emperor, and at length, as the result of
        astute statecraft and the necessities of the case, among the princes of
        Europe, as their chief and arbiter. So much as has been said was,
        however, necessary for the comprehension of the task with which
        Catherine measured, for the time, successfully her strength. It was
        given to the Popolana of Siena, by the effect of her eloquence in
        persuading the wavering will of the Pope to return to his See, to bring
        about what was, for the moment, the only possible solution of that Roman
        question, which, hanging perpetually round the skirts of the Bride of
        Christ, seems at every step to impede her victorious advance. 
         * * * 
         &nbsp; 
         Nevertheless, it is neither the intrinsic importance nor the social
        consequences of her actions that constitute the true greatness of St.
        Catherine. Great ends may be pursued by essentially small means, in an
        aridity and narrowness of temper that goes far to discount their actual
        achievement. History, and in particular the history of the Church, is
        not wanting in such instances. Savonarola set great ends before himself
        -- the freedom of his country and the regeneration of the state; but the
        spirit in which he pursued them excludes him from that Pantheon of
        gracious souls in which humanity enshrines its true benefactors.
        "Soul, as a quality of style, is a fact," and the soul of St.
        Catherine's gesta expressed itself in a "style" so winning, so
        sweetly reasonable, as to make her the dearest of friends to all who had
        the privilege of intimate association with her, and a permanent source
        of refreshment to the human spirit. She intuitively perceived life under
        the highest possible forms, the forms of Beauty and Love. Truth and
        Goodness were, she thought, means for the achievement of those two
        supreme ends. The sheer beauty of the soul "in a state of
        Grace" is a point on which she constantly dwells, hanging it as a
        bait before those whom she would induce to turn from evil. Similarly the
        ugliness of sin, as much as its wickedness, should warn us of its true
        nature. Love, that love of man for man which, in deepest truth, is, in
        the words of the writer of the First Epistle of St. John, God Himself,
        is, at once, the highest achievement of man and his supreme and
        satisfying beatitude. The Symbols of Catholic theology were to her the
        necessary and fitting means of transit, so to speak. See, in the
        following pages, the fine allegory of the Bridge of the Sacred Humanity,
        of the soul  in via  on its dusty pilgrimage towards those gleaming
        heights of vision. "Truth" was to her the handmaid of the
        spiritualized imagination, not, as too often in these days of the
        twilight of the soul, its tyrant and its gaoler. Many of those who pass
        lives of unremitting preoccupation with the problems of truth and
        goodness are wearied and cumbered with much serving. We honor them, and
        rightly; but if they have nothing but this to offer us, our hearts do
        not run to meet them, as they fly to the embrace of those rare souls who
        inhabit a serener, more pellucid atmosphere. Among these spirits of the
        air, St. Catherine has taken a permanent and foremost place. She is
        among the few guides of humanity who have the perfect manner, the
        irresistible attractiveness, of that positive purity of heart, which not
        only sees God, but diffuses Him, as by some natural law of refraction,
        over the hearts of men. The Divine nuptials, about which the mystics
        tell us so much, have been accomplished in her, Nature and Grace have
        lain down together, and the mysteries of her religion seem but the
        natural expression of a perfectly balanced character, an unquenchable
        love and a deathless will. 
         * * * 
         The Dialogue of St. Catherine of Siena was dictated to her
        secretaries by the Saint in ecstasy. Apart from the extraordinary
        circumstances of its production, this work has a special interest. The
        composition of the Siennese dyer's daughter, whose will, purified and
        sublimated by prayer, imposed itself on popes and princes, is an almost
        unique specimen of what may be called "ecclesiastical"
        mysticism; for its special value lies in the fact that from first to
        last it is nothing more than a mystical exposition of the creeds taught
        to every child in the Catholic poor-schools. Her insight is sometimes
        very wonderful. How subtle, for instance, is the analysis of the state
        of the "worldly man" who loves God for his own pleasure or
        profit! The special snares of the devout are cut through by the keen
        logic of one who has experienced and triumphed over them. Terrible,
        again, is the retribution prophesied to the "unworthy ministers of
        the Blood." 
         And so every well-known form of Christian life, healthy or parasitic,
        is treated of, detailed, analyzed incisively, remorselessly, and then
        subsumed under the general conception of God's infinite loving-kindness
        and mercy. 
         The great mystics have usually taken as their starting-point what, to
        most, is the goal hardly to be reached; their own treatment of the
        preliminary stages of spirituality is frequently conventional and
        jejune. Compare, for instance, the first book with the two succeeding
        ones, of Ruysbrock's  Ornement des Noces spirituelles , that unique
        breviary of the Christian Platonician. Another result of their having
        done so is that, with certain noble exceptions, the literature of this
        subject has fallen into the hands of a class of writers, or rather
        purveyors, well-intentioned no doubt, but not endowed with the higher
        spiritual and mental faculties, whom it is not unfair to describe as the
        feuilletonistes of piety. Such works, brightly bound, are appropriately
        exposed for sale in the Roman shop-windows, among the gaudy objets de
        religion they so much resemble. To keep healthy and raise the tone of
        devotional literature is surely an eighth spiritual work of mercy. St.
        Philip Neri's advice in the matter was to prefer those writers whose
        names were preceded by the title of Saint. In the Dialogo we have a
        great saint, one of the most extraordinary women who ever lived,
        treating, in a manner so simple and familiar as at times to become
        almost colloquial, of the elements of practical Christianity. Passages
        occur frequently of lofty eloquence, and also of such literary
        perfection that this book is held by critics to be one of the classics
        of the age and land which produced Boccaccio and Petrarch. To-day, in
        the streets of Siena, the same Tuscan idiom can be heard, hardly altered
        since the days of St. Catherine. 
         One word as to the translation. I have almost always followed the
        text of Gigli, a learned Siennese ecclesiastic, who edited the complete
        works of St. Catherine in the last century. His is the latest edition
        printed of the Dialogo. Once or twice I have preferred the cinquecento
        Venetian editor. My aim has been to translate as literally as possible,
        and at the same time to preserve the characteristic rhythm of the
        sentences, so suggestive in its way of the sing-song articulation of the
        Siennese of today. St. Catherine has no style as such; she introduces a
        metaphor and forgets it; the sea, a vine, and a plough will often appear
        in the same sentence, sometimes in the same phrase. In such cases I have
        occasionally taken the liberty of adhering to the first simile when the
        confusion of metaphor in the original involves hopeless obscurity of
        expression.

         A TREATISE OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE 
         
         How a soul, elevated by desire of the honor of God, and of the
        salvation of her neighbors, exercising herself in humble prayer, after
        she had seen the union of the soul, through love, with God, asked of God
        four requests. 
          
         The soul, who is lifted by a very great and yearning desire for the
        honor of God and the salvation of souls, begins by exercising herself,
        for a certain space of time, in the ordinary virtues, remaining in the
        cell of self-knowledge, in order to know better the goodness of God
        towards her. This she does because knowledge must precede love, and only
        when she has attained love, can she strive to follow and to clothe
        herself with the truth. But, in no way, does the creature receive such a
        taste of the truth, or so brilliant a light therefrom, as by means of
        humble and continuous prayer, founded on knowledge of herself and of
        God; because prayer, exercising her in the above way, unites with God
        the soul that follows the footprints of Christ Crucified, and thus, by
        desire and affection, and union of love, makes her another Himself.
        Christ would seem to have meant this, when He said: To him who will love
        Me and will observe My commandment, will I manifest Myself; and he shall
        be one thing with Me and I with him. In several places we find similar
        words, by which we can see that it is, indeed, through the effect of
        love, that the soul becomes another Himself. That this may be seen more
        clearly, I will mention what I remember having heard from a handmaid of
        God, namely, that, when she was lifted up in prayer, with great
        elevation of mind, God was not wont to conceal, from the eye of her
        intellect, the love which He had for His servants, but rather to
        manifest it; and, that among other things, He used to say: "Open
        the eye of your intellect, and gaze into Me, and you shall see the
        beauty of My rational creature. And look at those creatures who, among
        the beauties which I have given to the soul, creating her in My image
        and similitude, are clothed with the nuptial garment (that is, the
        garment of love), adorned with many virtues, by which they are united
        with Me through love. And yet I tell you, if you should ask Me, who
        these are, I should reply" (said the sweet and amorous Word of God)
        "they are another Myself, inasmuch as they have lost and denied
        their own will, and are clothed with Mine, are united to Mine, are
        conformed to Mine." It is therefore true, indeed, that the soul
        unites herself with God by the affection of love. So, that soul, wishing
        to know and follow the truth more manfully, and lifting her desires
        first for herself -- for she considered that a soul could not be of use,
        whether in doctrine, example, or prayer, to her neighbor, if she did not
        first profit herself, that is, if she did not acquire virtue in herself
        -- addressed four requests to the Supreme and Eternal Father. The first
        was for herself; the second for the reformation of the Holy Church; the
        third a general prayer for the whole world, and in particular for the
        peace of Christians who rebel, with much lewdness and persecution,
        against the Holy Church; in the fourth and last, she besought the Divine
        Providence to provide for things in general, and in particular, for a
        certain case with which she was concerned. 
          
         How the desire of this soul grew when God showed her the neediness of
        the world. 
          
         This desire was great and continuous, but grew much more, when the
        First Truth showed her the neediness of the world, and in what a tempest
        of offense against God it lay. And she had understood this the better
        from a letter, which she had received from the spiritual Father of her
        soul, in which he explained to her the penalties and intolerable dolor
        caused by offenses against God, and the loss of souls, and the
        persecutions of Holy Church. 
         All this lighted the fire of her holy desire with grief for the
        offenses, and with the joy of the lively hope, with which she waited for
        God to provide against such great evils. And, since the soul seems, in
        such communion, sweetly to bind herself fast within herself and with
        God, and knows better His truth, inasmuch as the soul is then in God,
        and God in the soul, as the fish is in the sea, and the sea in the fish,
        she desired the arrival of the morning (for the morrow was a feast of
        Mary) in order to hear Mass. And, when the morning came, and the hour of
        the Mass, she sought with anxious desire her accustomed place; and, with
        a great knowledge of herself, being ashamed of her own imperfection,
        appearing to herself to be the cause of all the evil that was happening
        throughout the world, conceiving a hatred and displeasure against
        herself, and a feeling of holy justice, with which knowledge, hatred,
        and justice, she purified the stains which seemed to her to cover her
        guilty soul, she said: "O Eternal Father, I accuse myself before
        You, in order that You may punish me for my sins in this finite life,
        and, inasmuch as my sins are the cause of the sufferings which my
        neighbor must endure, I implore You, in Your kindness, to punish them in
        my person." 
          
         How finite works are not sufficient for punishment or recompense
        without the perpetual affection of love. 
          
         Then, the Eternal Truth seized and drew more strongly to Himself her
        desire, doing as He did in the Old Testament, for when the sacrifice was
        offered to God, a fire descended and drew to Him the sacrifice that was
        acceptable to Him; so did the sweet Truth to that soul, in sending down
        the fire of the clemency of the Holy Spirit, seizing the sacrifice of
        desire that she made of herself, saying: "Do you not know, dear
        daughter, that all the sufferings, which the soul endures, or can
        endure, in this life, are insufficient to punish one smallest fault,
        because the offense, being done to Me, who am the Infinite Good, calls
        for an infinite satisfaction? However, I wish that you should know, that
        not all the pains that are given to men in this life are given as
        punishments, but as corrections, in order to chastise a son when he
        offends; though it is true that both the guilt and the penalty can be
        expiated by the desire of the soul, that is, by true contrition, not
        through the finite pain endured, but through the infinite desire;
        because God, who is infinite, wishes for infinite love and infinite
        grief. Infinite grief I wish from My creature in two ways: in one way,
        through her sorrow for her own sins, which she has committed against Me
        her Creator; in the other way, through her sorrow for the sins which she
        sees her neighbors commit against Me. Of such as these, inasmuch as they
        have infinite desire, that is, are joined to Me by an affection of love,
        and therefore grieve when they offend Me, or see Me offended, their
        every pain, whether spiritual or corporeal, from wherever it may come,
        receives infinite merit, and satisfies for a guilt which deserved an
        infinite penalty, although their works are finite and done in finite
        time; but, inasmuch as they possess the virtue of desire, and sustain
        their suffering with desire, and contrition, and infinite displeasure
        against their guilt, their pain is held worthy. Paul explained this when
        he said: If I had the tongues of angels, and if I knew the things of the
        future and gave my body to be burned, and have not love, it would be
        worth nothing to me. The glorious Apostle thus shows that finite works
        are not valid, either as punishment or recompense, without the condiment
        of the affection of love." 
          
         How desire and contrition of heart satisfies, both for the guilt and
        the penalty in oneself and in others; and how sometimes it satisfies for
        the guilt only, and not the penalty. 
          
         "I have shown you, dearest daughter, that the guilt is not
        punished in this finite time by any pain which is sustained purely as
        such. And I say, that the guilt is punished by the pain which is endured
        through the desire, love, and contrition of the heart; not by virtue of
        the pain, but by virtue of the desire of the soul; inasmuch as desire
        and every virtue is of value, and has life in itself, through Christ
        crucified, My only begotten Son, in so far as the soul has drawn her
        love from Him, and virtuously follows His virtues, that is, His
        Footprints. In this way, and in no other, are virtues of value, and in
        this way, pains satisfy for the fault, by the sweet and intimate love
        acquired in the knowledge of My goodness, and in the bitterness and
        contrition of heart acquired by knowledge of one's self and one's own
        thoughts. And this knowledge generates a hatred and displeasure against
        sin, and against the soul's own sensuality, through which, she deems
        herself worthy of pains and unworthy of reward." 
         The sweet Truth continued: "See how, by contrition of the heart,
        together with love, with true patience, and with true humility, deeming
        themselves worthy of pain and unworthy of reward, such souls endure the
        patient humility in which consists the above-mentioned satisfaction. You
        ask me, then, for pains, so that I may receive satisfaction for the
        offenses, which are done against Me by My Creatures, and you further ask
        the will to know and love Me, who am the Supreme Truth. Wherefore I
        reply that this is the way, if you will arrive at a perfect knowledge
        and enjoyment of Me, the Eternal Truth, that you should never go outside
        the knowledge of yourself, and, by humbling yourself in the valley of
        humility, you will know Me and yourself, from which knowledge you will
        draw all that is necessary. No virtue, my daughter, can have life in
        itself except through charity, and humility, which is the foster-mother
        and nurse of charity. In self-knowledge, then, you will humble yourself,
        seeing that, in yourself, you do not even exist; for your very being, as
        you will learn, is derived from Me, since I have loved both you and
        others before you were in existence; and that, through the ineffable
        love which I had for you, wishing to re-create you to Grace, I have
        washed you, and re-created you in the Blood of My only-begotten Son,
        spilt with so great a fire of love. This Blood teaches the truth to him,
        who, by self-knowledge, dissipates the cloud of self-love, and in no
        other way can he learn. Then the soul will inflame herself in this
        knowledge of Me with an ineffable love, through which love she continues
        in constant pain; not, however, a pain which afflicts or dries up the
        soul, but one which rather fattens her; for since she has known My
        truth, and her own faults, and the ingratitude of men, she endures
        intolerable suffering, grieving because she loves Me; for, if she did
        not love Me, she would not be obliged to do so; whence it follows
        immediately, that it is right for you, and My other servants who have
        learnt My truth in this way, to sustain, even unto death, many
        tribulations and injuries and insults in word and deed, for the glory
        and praise of My Name; thus will you endure and suffer pains. Do you,
        therefore, and My other servants, carry yourselves with true patience,
        with grief for your sins, and with love of virtue for the glory and
        praise of My Name. If you act thus, I will satisfy for your sins, and
        for those of My other servants, inasmuch as the pains which you will
        endure will be sufficient, through the virtue of love, for satisfaction
        and reward, both in you and in others. In yourself you will receive the
        fruit of life, when the stains of your ignorance are effaced, and I
        shall not remember that you ever offended Me. In others I will satisfy
        through the love and affection which you have to Me, and I will give to
        them according to the disposition with which they will receive My gifts.
        In particular, to those who dispose themselves, humbly and with
        reverence, to receive the doctrine of My servants, will I remit both
        guilt and penalty, since they will thus come to true knowledge and
        contrition for their sins. So that, by means of prayer, and their desire
        of serving Me, they receive the fruit of grace, receiving it humbly in
        greater or less degree, according to the extent of their exercise of
        virtue and grace in general. I say then, that, through your desires,
        they will receive remission for their sins. See, however, the condition,
        namely, that their obstinacy should not be so great in their despair as
        to condemn them through contempt of the Blood, which, with such
        sweetness, has restored them. 
         "What fruit do they receive? 
         "The fruit which I destine for them, constrained by the prayers
        of My servants, is that I give them light, and that I wake up in them
        the hound of conscience, and make them smell the odor of virtue, and
        take delight in the conversation of My servants. 
         "Sometimes I allow the world to show them what it is, so that,
        feeling its diverse and various passions, they may know how little
        stability it has, and may come to lift their desire beyond it, and seek
        their native country, which is the Eternal Life. And so I draw them by
        these, and by many other ways, for the eye cannot see, nor the tongue
        relate, nor the heart think, how many are the roads and ways which I
        use, through love alone, to lead them back to grace, so that My truth
        may be fulfilled in them. I am constrained to do so by that inestimable
        love of Mine, by which I created them, and by the love, desire, and
        grief of My servants, since I am no despiser of their tears, and sweat,
        and humble prayers; rather I accept them, inasmuch as I am He who give
        them this love for the good of souls and grief for their loss. But I do
        not, in general, grant to these others, for whom they pray, satisfaction
        for the penalty due to them, but, only for their guilt, since they are
        not disposed, on their side, to receive, with perfect love, My love, and
        that of My servants. They do not receive their grief with bitterness,
        and perfect contrition for the sins they have committed, but with
        imperfect love and contrition, wherefore they have not, as others,
        remission of the penalty, but only of the guilt; because such complete
        satisfaction requires proper dispositions on both sides, both in him
        that gives and him that receives. Wherefore, since they are imperfect,
        they receive imperfectly the perfection of the desires of those who
        offer them to Me, for their sakes, with suffering; and, inasmuch as I
        told you that they do receive remission, this is indeed the truth, that,
        by that way which I have told you, that is, by the light of conscience,
        and by other things, satisfaction is made for their guilt; for,
        beginning to learn, they vomit forth the corruption of their sins, and
        so receive the gift of grace. 
         "These are they who are in a state of ordinary charity,
        wherefore, if they have trouble, they receive it in the guise of
        correction, and do not resist over much the clemency of the Holy Spirit,
        but, coming out of their sin, they receive the life of grace. But if,
        like fools, they are ungrateful, and ignore Me and the labors of My
        servants done for them, that which was given them, through mercy, turns
        to their own ruin and judgment, not through defect of mercy, nor through
        defect of him who implored the mercy for the ingrate, but solely through
        the man's own wretchedness and hardness, with which, with the hands of
        his free will, he has covered his heart, as it were, with a diamond,
        which, if it be not broken by the Blood, can in no way be broken. And
        yet, I say to you, that, in spite of his hardness of heart, he can use
        his free will while he has time, praying for the Blood of My Son, and
        let him with his own hand apply It to the diamond over his heart and
        shiver it, and he will receive the imprint of the Blood which has been
        paid for him. But, if he delays until the time be past, he has no
        remedy, because he has not used the dowry which I gave him, giving him
        memory so as to remember My benefits, intellect, so as to see and know
        the truth, affection, so that he should love Me, the Eternal Truth, whom
        he would have known through the use of his intellect. This is the dowry
        which I have given you all, and which ought to render fruit to Me, the
        Father; but, if a man barters and sells it to the devil, the devil, if
        he choose, has a right to seize on everything that he has acquired in
        this life. And, filling his memory with the delights of sin, and with
        the recollection of shameful pride, avarice, self-love, hatred, and
        unkindness to his neighbors (being also a persecutor of My servants),
        with these miseries, he has obscured his intellect by his disordinate
        will. Let such as these receive the eternal pains, with their horrible
        stench, inasmuch as they have not satisfied for their sins with
        contrition and displeasure of their guilt. Now, therefore, you have
        understood how suffering satisfies for guilt by perfect contrition, not
        through the finite pain; and such as have this contrition in perfection
        satisfy not only for the guilt, but also for the penalty which follows
        the guilt, as I have already said when speaking in general; and if they
        satisfy for the guilt alone, that is, if, having abandoned mortal sin,
        they receive grace, and have not sufficient contrition and love to
        satisfy for the penalty also, they go to the pains of Purgatory, passing
        through the second and last means of satisfaction. 
         "So you see that satisfaction is made, through the desire of the
        soul united to Me, who am the Infinite Good, in greater or less degree,
        according to the measure of love, obtained by the desire and prayer of
        the recipient. Wherefore, with that very same measure with which a man
        measures to Me, do he receive in himself the measure of My goodness.
        Labor, therefore, to increase the fire of your desire, and let not a
        moment pass without crying to Me with humble voice, or without continual
        prayers before Me for your neighbors. I say this to you and to the
        father of your soul, whom I have given you on earth. Bear yourselves
        with manful courage, and make yourselves dead to all your own
        sensuality." 
          
         How very pleasing to God is the willing desire to suffer for Him. 
          
         "Very pleasing to Me, dearest daughter, is the willing desire to
        bear every pain and fatigue, even unto death, for the salvation of
        souls, for the more the soul endures, the more she shows that she loves
        Me; loving Me she comes to know more of My truth, and the more she
        knows, the more pain and intolerable grief she feels at the offenses
        committed against Me. You asked Me to sustain you, and to punish the
        faults of others in you, and you did not remark that you were really
        asking for love, light, and knowledge of the truth, since I have already
        told you that, by the increase of love, grows grief and pain, wherefore
        he that grows in love grows in grief. Therefore, I say to you all, that
        you should ask, and it will be given you, for I deny nothing to him who
        asks of Me in truth. Consider that the love of divine charity is so
        closely joined in the soul with perfect patience, that neither can leave
        the soul without the other. For this reason (if the soul elect to love
        Me) she should elect to endure pains for Me in whatever mode or
        circumstance I may send them to her. Patience cannot be proved in any
        other way than by suffering, and patience is united with love as has
        been said. Therefore bear yourselves with manly courage, for, unless you
        do so, you will not prove yourselves to be spouses of My Truth, and
        faithful children, nor of the company of those who relish the taste of
        My honor, and the salvation of souls." 
          
         How every virtue and every defect is obtained by means of our
        neighbor. 
          
         "I wish also that you should know that every virtue is obtained
        by means of your neighbor, and likewise, every defect; he, therefore,
        who stands in hatred of Me, does an injury to his neighbor, and to
        himself, who is his own chief neighbor, and this injury is both general
        and particular. It is general because you are obliged to love your
        neighbor as yourself, and loving him, you ought to help him spiritually,
        with prayer, counseling him with words, and assisting him both
        spiritually and temporally, according to the need in which he may be, at
        least with your goodwill if you have nothing else. A man therefore, who
        does not love, does not help him, and thereby does himself an injury;
        for he cuts off from himself grace, and injures his neighbor, by
        depriving him of the benefit of the prayers and of the sweet desires
        that he is bound to offer for him to Me. Thus, every act of help that he
        performs should proceed from the charity which he has through love of
        Me. And every evil also, is done by means of his neighbor, for, if he do
        not love Me, he cannot be in charity with his neighbor; and thus, all
        evils derive from the soul's deprivation of love of Me and her neighbor;
        whence, inasmuch as such a man does no good, it follows that he must do
        evil. To whom does he evil? First of all to himself, and then to his
        neighbor, not against Me, for no evil can touch Me, except in so far as
        I count done to Me that which he does to himself. To himself he does the
        injury of sin, which deprives him of grace, and worse than this he
        cannot do to his neighbor. Him he injures in not paying him the debt,
        which he owes him, of love, with which he ought to help him by means of
        prayer and holy desire offered to Me for him. This is an assistance
        which is owed in general to every rational creature; but its usefulness
        is more particular when it is done to those who are close at hand, under
        your eyes, as to whom, I say, you are all obliged to help one another by
        word and doctrine, and the example of good works, and in every other
        respect in which your neighbor may be seen to be in need; counseling him
        exactly as you would yourselves, without any passion of self-love; and
        he (a man not loving God) does not do this, because he has no love
        towards his neighbor; and, by not doing it, he does him, as you see, a
        special injury. And he does him evil, not only by not doing him the good
        that he might do him, but by doing him a positive injury and a constant
        evil. In this way sin causes a physical and a mental injury. The mental
        injury is already done when the sinner has conceived pleasure in the
        idea of sin, and hatred of virtue, that is, pleasure from sensual
        self-love, which has deprived him of the affection of love which he
        ought to have towards Me, and his neighbor, as has been said. And, after
        he has conceived, he brings forth one sin after another against his
        neighbor, according to the diverse ways which may please his perverse
        sensual will. Sometimes it is seen that he brings forth cruelty, and
        that both in general and in particular. 
         "His general cruelty is to see himself and other creatures in
        danger of death and damnation through privation of grace, and so cruel
        is he that he reminds neither himself nor others of the love of virtue
        and hatred of vice. Being thus cruel he may wish to extend his cruelty
        still further, that is, not content with not giving an example of
        virtue, the villain also usurps the office of the demons, tempting,
        according to his power, his fellow-creatures to abandon virtue for vice;
        this is cruelty towards his neighbors, for he makes himself an
        instrument to destroy life and to give death. Cruelty towards the body
        has its origin in cupidity, which not only prevents a man from helping
        his neighbor, but causes him to seize the goods of others, robbing the
        poor creatures; sometimes this is done by the arbitrary use of power,
        and at other times by cheating and fraud, his neighbor being forced to
        redeem, to his own loss, his own goods, and often indeed his own person. 
         "Oh, miserable vice of cruelty, which will deprive the man who
        practices it of all mercy, unless he turn to kindness and benevolence
        towards his neighbor! 
         "Sometimes the sinner brings forth insults on which often
        follows murder; sometimes also impurity against the person of his
        neighbor, by which he becomes a brute beast full of stench, and in this
        case he does not poison one only, but whoever approaches him, with love
        or in conversation, is poisoned. 
         "Against whom does pride bring forth evils? Against the
        neighbor, through love of one's own reputation, whence comes hatred of
        the neighbor, reputing one's self to be greater than he; and in this way
        is injury done to him. And if a man be in a position of authority, he
        produces also injustice and cruelty and becomes a retailer of the flesh
        of men. Oh, dearest daughter, grieve for the offense against Me, and
        weep over these corpses, so that, by prayer, the bands of their death
        may be loosened! 
         "See now, that, in all places and in all kinds of people, sin is
        always produced against the neighbor, and through his medium; in no
        other way could sin ever be committed either secret or open. A secret
        sin is when you deprive your neighbor of that which you ought to give
        him; an open sin is where you perform positive acts of sin, as I have
        related to you. It is, therefore, indeed the truth that every sin done
        against Me, is done through the medium of the neighbor." 
          
         How virtues are accomplished by means of our neighbor, and how it is
        that virtues differ to such an extent in creatures. 
          
         "I have told you how all sins are accomplished by means of your
        neighbor, through the principles which I exposed to you, that is,
        because men are deprived of the affection of love, which gives light to
        every virtue. In the same way self-love, which destroys charity and
        affection towards the neighbor, is the principle and foundation of every
        evil. All scandals, hatred, cruelty, and every sort of trouble proceed
        from this perverse root of self-love, which has poisoned the entire
        world, and weakened the mystical body of the Holy Church, and the
        universal body of the believers in the Christian religion; and,
        therefore, I said to you, that it was in the neighbor, that is to say in
        the love of him, that all virtues were founded; and, truly indeed did I
        say to you, that charity gives life to all the virtues, because no
        virtue can be obtained without charity, which is the pure love of Me. 
         "Wherefore, when the soul knows herself, as we have said above,
        she finds humility and hatred of her own sensual passion, for she learns
        the perverse law, which is bound up in her members, and which ever
        fights against the spirit. And, therefore, arising with hatred of her
        own sensuality, crushing it under the heel of reason, with great
        earnestness, she discovers in herself the bounty of My goodness, through
        the many benefits which she has received from Me, all of which she
        considers again in herself. She attributes to Me, through humility, the
        knowledge which she has obtained of herself, knowing that, by My grace,
        I have drawn her out of darkness and lifted her up into the light of
        true knowledge. When she has recognized My goodness, she loves it
        without any medium, and yet at the same time with a medium, that is to
        say, without the medium of herself or of any advantage accruing to
        herself, and with the medium of virtue, which she has conceived through
        love of Me, because she sees that, in no other way, can she become
        grateful and acceptable to Me, but by conceiving, hatred of sin and love
        of virtue; and, when she has thus conceived by the affection of love,
        she immediately is delivered of fruit for her neighbor, because, in no
        other way, can she act out the truth she has conceived in herself, but,
        loving Me in truth, in the same truth she serves her neighbor. 
         "And it cannot be otherwise, because love of Me and of her
        neighbor are one and the same thing, and, so far as the soul loves Me,
        she loves her neighbor, because love towards him issues from Me. This is
        the means which I have given you, that you may exercise and prove your
        virtue therewith; because, inasmuch as you can do Me no profit, you
        should do it to your neighbor. This proves that you possess Me by grace
        in your soul, producing much fruit for your neighbor and making prayers
        to Me, seeking with sweet and amorous desire My honor and the salvation
        of souls. The soul, enamored of My truth, never ceases to serve the
        whole world in general, and more or less in a particular case according
        to the disposition of the recipient and the ardent desire of the donor,
        as I have shown above, when I declared to you that the endurance of
        suffering alone, without desire, was not sufficient to punish a fault. 
         "When she has discovered the advantage of this unitive love in
        Me, by means of which, she truly loves herself, extending her desire for
        the salvation of the whole world, thus coming to the aid of its
        neediness, she strives, inasmuch as she has done good to herself by the
        conception of virtue, from which she has drawn the life of grace, to fix
        her eye on the needs of her neighbor in particular. Wherefore, when she
        has discovered, through the affection of love, the state of all rational
        creatures in general, she helps those who are at hand, according to the
        various graces which I have entrusted to her to administer; one she
        helps with doctrine, that is, with words, giving sincere counsel without
        any respect of persons, another with the example of a good life, and
        this indeed all give to their neighbor, the edification of a holy and
        honorable life. These are the virtues, and many others, too many to
        enumerate, which are brought forth in the love of the neighbor; but,
        although I have given them in such a different way, that is to say not
        all to one, but to one, one virtue, and to another, another, it so
        happens that it is impossible to have one, without having them all,
        because all the virtues are bound together. Wherefore, learn, that, in
        many cases I give one virtue, to be as it were the chief of the others,
        that is to say, to one I will give principally love, to another justice,
        to another humility, to one a lively faith, to another prudence or
        temperance, or patience, to another fortitude. These, and many other
        virtues, I place, indifferently, in the souls of many creatures; it
        happens, therefore, that the particular one so placed in the soul
        becomes the principal object of its virtue; the soul disposing herself,
        for her chief conversation, to this rather than to other virtues, and,
        by the effect of this virtue, the soul draws to herself all the other
        virtues, which, as has been said, are all bound together in the
        affection of love; and so with many gifts and graces of virtue, and not
        only in the case of spiritual things but also of temporal. I use the
        word temporal for the things necessary to the physical life of man; all
        these I have given indifferently, and I have not placed them all in one
        soul, in order that man should, perforce, have material for love of his
        fellow. I could easily have created men possessed of all that they
        should need both for body and soul, but I wish that one should have need
        of the other, and that they should be My ministers to administer the
        graces and the gifts that they have received from Me. Whether man will
        or no, he cannot help making an act of love. It is true, however, that
        that act, unless made through love of Me, profits him nothing so far as
        grace is concerned. See then, that I have made men My ministers, and
        placed them in diverse stations and various ranks, in order that they
        may make use of the virtue of love. 
         "Wherefore, I show you that in My house are many mansions, and
        that I wish for no other thing than love, for in the love of Me is
        fulfilled and completed the love of the neighbor, and the law observed.
        For he, only, can be of use in his state of life, who is bound to Me
        with this love." 
          
         How virtues are proved and fortified by their contraries. 
          
         "Up to the present, I have taught you how a man may serve his
        neighbor, and manifest, by that service, the love which he has towards
        Me. "Now I wish to tell you further, that a man proves his patience
        on his neighbor, when he receives injuries from him. 
         "Similarly, he proves his humility on a proud man, his faith on
        an infidel, his true hope on one who despairs, his justice on the
        unjust, his kindness on the cruel, his gentleness and benignity on the
        irascible. Good men produce and prove all their virtues on their
        neighbor, just as perverse men all their vices; thus, if you consider
        well, humility is proved on pride in this way. The humble man
        extinguishes pride, because a proud man can do no harm to a humble one;
        neither can the infidelity of a wicked man, who neither loves Me, nor
        hopes in Me, when brought forth against one who is faithful to Me, do
        him any harm; his infidelity does not diminish the faith or the hope of
        him who has conceived his faith and hope through love of Me, it rather
        fortifies it, and proves it in the love he feels for his neighbor. For,
        he sees that the infidel is unfaithful, because he is without hope in
        Me, and in My servant, because he does not love Me, placing his faith
        and hope rather in his own sensuality, which is all that he loves. My
        faithful servant does not leave him because he does not faithfully love
        Me, or because he does not constantly seek, with hope in Me, for his
        salvation, inasmuch as he sees clearly the causes of his infidelity and
        lack of hope. The virtue of faith is proved in these and other ways.
        Wherefore, to those, who need the proof of it, My servant proves his
        faith in himself and in his neighbor, and so, justice is not diminished
        by the wicked man's injustice, but is rather proved, that is to say, the
        justice of a just man. Similarly, the virtues of patience, benignity,
        and kindness manifest themselves in a time of wrath by the same sweet
        patience in My servants, and envy, vexation, and hatred demonstrate
        their love, and hunger and desire for the salvation of souls. I say,
        also, to you, that, not only is virtue proved in those who render good
        for evil, but, that many times a good man gives back fiery coals of
        love, which dispel the hatred and rancor of heart of the angry, and so
        from hatred often comes benevolence, and that this is by virtue of the
        love and perfect patience which is in him, who sustains the anger of the
        wicked, bearing and supporting his defects. If you will observe the
        virtues of fortitude and perseverance, these virtues are proved by the
        long endurance of the injuries and detractions of wicked men, who,
        whether by injuries or by flattery, constantly endeavor to turn a man
        aside from following the road and the doctrine of truth. Wherefore, in
        all these things, the virtue of fortitude conceived within the soul,
        perseveres with strength, and, in addition proves itself externally upon
        the neighbor, as I have said to you; and, if fortitude were not able to
        make that good proof of itself, being tested by many contrarieties, it
        would not be a serious virtue founded in truth." 
          
         A TREATISE OF DISCRETION 
          
         How the affection should not place reliance chiefly on penance, but
        rather on virtues; and how discretion receives life from humility, and
        renders to each man his due. 
          
         "These are the holy and sweet works which I seek from My
        servants; these are the proved intrinsic virtues of the soul, as I have
        told you. They not only consist of those virtues which are done by means
        of the body, that is, with an exterior act, or with diverse and varied
        penances, which are the instruments of virtue; works of penance
        performed alone without the above-mentioned virtues would please Me
        little; often, indeed, if the soul perform not her penance with
        discretion, that is to say, if her affection be placed principally in
        the penance she has undertaken, her perfection will be impeded; she
        should rather place reliance on the affection of love, with a holy
        hatred of herself, accompanied by true humility and perfect patience,
        together with the other intrinsic virtues of the soul, with hunger and
        desire for My honor and the salvation of souls. For these virtues
        demonstrate that the will is dead, and continually slays its own
        sensuality through the affection of love of virtue. With this
        discretion, then, should the soul perform her penance, that is, she
        should place her principal affection in virtue rather than in penance.
        Penance should be but the means to increase virtue according to the
        needs of the individual, and according to what the soul sees she can do
        in the measure of her own possibility. Otherwise, if the soul place her
        foundation on penance she will contaminate her own perfection, because
        her penance will not be done in the light of knowledge of herself and of
        My goodness, with discretion, and she will not seize hold of My truth;
        neither loving that which I love, nor hating that which I hate. This
        virtue of discretion is no other than a true knowledge which the soul
        should have of herself and of Me, and in this knowledge is virtue
        rooted. Discretion is the only child of self-knowledge, and, wedding
        with charity, has indeed many other descendants, as a tree which has
        many branches; but that which gives life to the tree, to its branches,
        and its root, is the ground of humility, in which it is planted, which
        humility is the foster-mother and nurse of charity, by whose means this
        tree remains in the perpetual calm of discretion. Because otherwise the
        tree would not produce the virtue of discretion, or any fruit of life,
        if it were not planted in the virtue of humility, because humility
        proceeds from self-knowledge. And I have already said to you, that the
        root of discretion is a real knowledge of self and of My goodness, by
        which the soul immediately, and discreetly, renders to each one his due.
        Chiefly to Me in rendering praise and glory to My Name, and in referring
        to Me the graces and the gifts which she sees and knows she has received
        from Me; and rendering to herself that which she sees herself to have
        merited, knowing that she does not even exist of herself, and
        attributing to Me, and not to herself, her being, which she knows she
        has received by grace from Me, and every other grace which she has
        received besides. 
         "And she seems to herself to be ungrateful for so many benefits,
        and negligent, in that she has not made the most of her time, and the
        graces she has received, and so seems to herself worthy of suffering;
        wherefore she becomes odious and displeasing to herself through her
        guilt. And this founds the virtue of discretion on knowledge of self,
        that is, on true humility, for, were this humility not in the soul, the
        soul would be indiscreet, indiscretion being founded on pride, as
        discretion is on humility. 
         "An indiscreet soul robs Me of the honor due to Me, and
        attributes it to herself, through vainglory, and that which is really
        her own she imputes to Me, grieving and murmuring concerning My
        mysteries, with which I work in her soul and in those of My other
        creatures; wherefore everything in Me and in her neighbor is cause of
        scandal to her. Contrariwise those who possess the virtue of discretion.
        For, when they have rendered what is due to Me and to themselves, they
        proceed to render to their neighbor their principal debt of love, and of
        humble and continuous prayer, which all should pay to each other, and
        further, the debt of doctrine, and example of a holy and honorable life,
        counseling and helping others according to their needs for salvation, as
        I said to you above. Whatever rank a man be in, whether that of a noble,
        a prelate, or a servant, if he have this virtue, everything that he does
        to his neighbor is done discreetly and lovingly, because these virtues
        are bound and mingled together, and both planted in the ground of
        humility which proceeds from self-knowledge." 
          
         A parable showing how love, humility, and discretion are united; and
        how the soul should conform herself to this parable. 
          
         "Do you know how these three virtues stand together? It is, as
        if a circle were drawn on the surface of the earth, and a tree, with an
        off-shoot joined to its side, grew in the center of the circle. The tree
        is nourished in the earth contained in the diameter of the circle, for
        if the tree were out of the earth it would die, and give no fruit. Now,
        consider, in the same way, that the soul is a tree existing by love, and
        that it can live by nothing else than love; and, that if this soul have
        not in very truth the divine love of perfect charity, she cannot produce
        fruit of life, but only of death. It is necessary then, that the root of
        this tree, that is the affection of the soul, should grow in, and issue
        from the circle of true self-knowledge which is contained in Me, who
        have neither beginning nor end, like the circumference of the circle,
        for, turn as you will within a circle, inasmuch as the circumference has
        neither end nor beginning, you always remain within it. 
         "This knowledge of yourself and of Me is found in the earth of
        true humility, which is as wide as the diameter of the circle, that is
        as the knowledge of self and of Me (for, otherwise, the circle would not
        be without end and beginning, but would have its beginning in knowledge
        of self, and its end in confusion, if this knowledge were not contained
        in Me). Then the tree of love feeds itself on humility, bringing forth
        from its side the off-shoot of true discretion, in the way that I have
        already told you, from the heart of the tree, that is the affection of
        love which is in the soul, and the patience, which proves that I am in
        the soul and the soul in Me. This tree then, so sweetly planted,
        produces fragrant blossoms of virtue, with many scents of great variety,
        inasmuch as the soul renders fruit of grace and of utility to her
        neighbor, according to the zeal of those who come to receive fruit from
        My servants; and to Me she renders the sweet odor of glory and praise to
        My Name, and so fulfills the object of her creation. 
         "In this way, therefore, she reaches the term of her being, that
        is Myself, her God, who am Eternal Life. And these fruits cannot be
        taken from her without her will, inasmuch as they are all flavored with
        discretion, because they are all united, as has been said above." 
          
         How penance and other corporal exercises are to be taken as
        instruments for arriving at virtue, and not as the principal affection
        of the soul; and of the light of discretion in various other modes and
        operations. 
          
         "These are the fruits and the works which I seek from the soul,
        the proving, namely, of virtue in the time of need. And yet some time
        ago, if you remember, when you were desirous of doing great penance for
        My sake, asking, 'What can I do to endure suffering for You, oh Lord?' I
        replied to you, speaking in your mind, 'I take delight in few words and
        many works.' I wished to show you that he who merely calls on me with
        the sound of words, saying: 'Lord, Lord, I would do something for You,'
        and he, who desires for My sake to mortify his body with many penances,
        and not his own will, did not give Me much pleasure; but that I desired
        the manifold works of manly endurance with patience, together with the
        other virtues, which I have mentioned to you above, intrinsic to the
        soul, all of which must be in activity in order to obtain fruits worthy
        of grace. All other works, founded on any other principle than this, I
        judge to be a mere calling with words, because they are finite works,
        and I, who am Infinite, seek infinite works, that is an infinite
        perfection of love. 
         "I wish therefore that the works of penance, and of other
        corporal exercises, should be observed merely as means, and not as the
        fundamental affection of the soul. For, if the principal affection of
        the soul were placed in penance, I should receive a finite thing like a
        word, which, when it has issued from the mouth, is no more, unless it
        have issued with affection of the soul, which conceives and brings forth
        virtue in truth; that is, unless the finite operation, which I have
        called a word, should be joined with the affection or love, in which
        case it would be grateful and pleasant to Me. And this is because such a
        work would not be alone, but accompanied by true discretion, using
        corporal works as means, and not as the principal foundation; for it
        would not be becoming that that principal foundation should be placed in
        penance only, or in any exterior corporal act, such works being finite,
        since they are done in finite time, and also because it is often
        profitable that the creature omit them, and even that she be made to do
        so. 
         "Wherefore, when the soul omits them through necessity, being
        unable through various circumstances to complete an action which she has
        begun, or, as may frequently happen, through obedience at the order of
        her director, it is well; since, if she continued then to do them, she
        not only would receive no merit, but would offend Me; thus you see that
        they are merely finite. She ought, therefore, to adopt them as a means,
        and not as an end. For, if she takes them as an end she will be obliged,
        some time or other, to leave them, and will then remain empty. This, My
        trumpeter, the glorious Paul, taught you when he said in his epistle,
        that you should mortify the body and destroy self-will, knowing, that is
        to say, how to keep the rein on the body, macerating the flesh whenever
        it should wish to combat the spirit, but the will should be dead and
        annihilated in everything, and subject to My will, and this slaying of
        the will is that due which, as I told you, the virtue of discretion
        renders to the soul, that is to say, hatred and disgust of her own
        offenses and sensuality, which are acquired by self-knowledge. This is
        the knife which slays and cuts off all self-love founded in self-will.
        These then are they who give Me not only words but manifold works, and
        in these I take delight. And then I said that I desired few words, and
        many actions; by the use of the word 'many' I assign no particular
        number to you, because the affection of the soul, founded in love, which
        gives life to all the virtues and good works, should increase
        infinitely, and yet I do not, by this, exclude words, I merely said that
        I wished few of them, showing you that every actual operation, as such,
        was finite, and therefore I called them of little account; but they
        please Me when they are performed as the instruments of virtue, and not
        as a principal end in themselves. "However, no one should judge
        that he has greater perfection, because he performs great penances, and
        gives himself in excess to the slaying of his body, than he who does
        less, inasmuch as neither virtue nor merit consists therein; for
        otherwise he would be in an evil case, who, from some legitimate reason,
        was unable to do actual penance. Merit consists in the virtue of love
        alone, flavored with the light of true discretion, without which the
        soul is worth nothing. And this love should be directed to Me endlessly,
        boundlessly, since I am the Supreme and Eternal Truth. The soul can
        therefore place neither laws nor limits to her love for Me; but her love
        for her neighbor, on the contrary, is ordered in certain conditions. The
        light of discretion (which proceeds from love, as I have told you) gives
        to the neighbor a conditioned love, one that, being ordered aright, does
        not cause the injury of sin to self in order to be useful to others,
        for, if one single sin were committed to save the whole world from Hell,
        or to obtain one great virtue, the motive would not be a rightly ordered
        or discreet love, but rather indiscreet, for it is not lawful to perform
        even one act of great virtue and profit to others, by means of the guilt
        of sin. Holy discretion ordains that the soul should direct all her
        powers to My service with a manly zeal, and, that she should love her
        neighbor with such devotion that she would lay down a thousand times, if
        it were possible, the life of her body for the salvation of souls,
        enduring pains and torments so that her neighbor may have the life of
        grace, and giving her temporal substance for the profit and relief of
        his body. 
         "This is the supreme office of discretion which proceeds from
        charity. So you see how discreetly every soul, who wishes for grace,
        should pay her debts, that is, should love Me with an infinite love and
        without measure, but her neighbor with measure, with a restricted love,
        as I have said, not doing herself the injury of sin in order to be
        useful to others. This is St. Paul's counsel to you when he says that
        charity ought to be concerned first with self, otherwise it will never
        be of perfect utility to others. Because, when perfection is not in the
        soul, everything which the soul does for itself and for others is
        imperfect. It would not, therefore, be just that creatures, who are
        finite and created by Me, should be saved through offense done to Me,
        who am the Infinite Good. The more serious the fault is in such a case,
        the less fruit will the action produce; therefore, in no way should you
        ever incur the guilt of sin. 
         "And this true love knows well, because she carries with herself
        the light of holy discretion, that light which dissipates all darkness,
        takes away ignorance, and is the condiment of every instrument of
        virtue. Holy discretion is a prudence which cannot be cheated, a
        fortitude which cannot be beaten, a perseverance from end to end,
        stretching from Heaven to earth, that is, from knowledge of Me to
        knowledge of self, and from love of Me to love of others. And the soul
        escapes dangers by her true humility, and, by her prudence, flies all
        the nets of the world and its creatures, and, with unarmed hands, that
        is through much endurance, discomfits the devil and the flesh with this
        sweet and glorious light; knowing, by it, her own fragility, she renders
        to her weakness its due of hatred. 
         "Wherefore she has trampled on the world, and placed it under
        the feet of her affection, despising it, and holding it vile, and thus
        becoming lord of it, holding it as folly. And the men of the world
        cannot take her virtues from such a soul, but all their persecutions
        increase her virtues and prove them, which virtues have been at first
        conceived by the virtue of love, as has been said, and then are proved
        on her neighbor, and bring forth their fruit on him. Thus have I shown
        you, that, if virtue were not visible and did not shine in the time of
        trial, it would not have been truly conceived; for, I have already told
        you, that perfect virtue cannot exist and give fruit except by means of
        the neighbor, even as a woman, who has conceived a child, if she do not
        bring it forth, so that it may appear before the eyes of men, deprives
        her husband of his fame of paternity. It is the same with Me, who am the
        Spouse of the soul, if she do not produce the child of virtue, in the
        love of her neighbor, showing her child to him who is in need, both in
        general and in particular, as I have said to you before, so I declare
        now that, in truth, she has not conceived virtue at all; and this is
        also true of the vices, all of which are committed by means of the
        neighbor." 
          
         How this soul grew by means of the divine response, and how her
        sorrows grew less, and how she prayed to God for the Holy Church, and
        for her own people. 
          
         "Then that soul, thirsting and burning with the very great
        desire that she had conceived on learning the ineffable love of God,
        shown in His great goodness, and, seeing the breadth of His charity,
        that, with such sweetness, He had deigned to reply to her request and to
        satisfy it, giving hope to the sorrow which she had conceived, on
        account of offenses against God, and the damage of the Holy Church, and
        through His own mercy, which she saw through self-knowledge, diminished,
        and yet, at the same time, increased her sorrow. 
         "For, the Supreme and Eternal Father, in manifesting the way of
        perfection, showed her anew her own guilt, and the loss of souls, as has
        been said more fully above. Also because in the knowledge which the soul
        obtains of herself, she knows more of God, and knowing the goodness of
        God in herself, the sweet mirror of God, she knows her own dignity and
        indignity. Her dignity is that of her creation, seeing that she is the
        image of God, and this has been given her by grace, and not as her due.
        In that same mirror of the goodness of God, the soul knows her own
        indignity, which is the consequence of her own fault. Wherefore, as a
        man more readily sees spots on his face when he looks in a mirror, so,
        the soul who, with true knowledge of self, rises with desire, and gazes
        with the eye of the intellect at herself in the sweet mirror of God,
        knows better the stains of her own face, by the purity which she sees in
        Him. 
         "Wherefore, because light and knowledge increased in that soul
        in the aforesaid way, a sweet sorrow grew in her, and at the same time,
        her sorrow was diminished by the hope which the Supreme Truth gave her,
        and, as fire grows when it is fed with wood, so grew the fire in that
        soul to such an extent that it was no longer possible for the body to
        endure it without the departure of the soul; so that, had she not been
        surrounded by the strength of Him who is the Supreme Strength, it would
        not have been possible for her to have lived any longer. This soul then,
        being purified by the fire of divine love, which she found in the
        knowledge of herself and of God, and her hunger for the salvation of the
        whole world, and for the reformation of the Holy Church, having grown
        with her hope of obtaining the same, rose with confidence before the
        Supreme Father, showing Him the leprosy of the Holy Church, and the
        misery of the world, saying, as if with the words of Moses, 'My Lord,
        turn the eyes of Your mercy upon Your people, and upon the mystical body
        of the Holy Church, for You will be the more glorified if You pardon so
        many creatures, and give to them the light of knowledge, since all will
        render You praise when they see themselves escape through Your infinite
        goodness from the clouds of mortal sin, and from eternal damnation; and
        then You will not only be praised by my wretched self, who have so much
        offended You, and who am the cause and the instrument of all this evil,
        for which reason I pray Your divine and eternal love to take Your
        revenge on me, and to do mercy to Your people, and never will I depart
        from before Your presence until I see that you grant them mercy. For
        what is it to me if I have life, and Your people death, and the clouds
        of darkness cover Your spouse, when it is my own sins, and not those of
        Your other creatures, that are the principal cause of this? I desire,
        then, and beg of You, by Your grace, that You have mercy on Your people,
        and I adjure You that You do this by Your uncreated love which moved You
        Yourself to create man in Your image and similitude, saying, "Let
        us make man in our own image," and this You did, oh eternal
        Trinity, that man might participate in everything belonging to You, the
        most high and eternal Trinity.' 
         "Wherefore You gave him memory in order to receive Your
        benefits, by which he participates in the power of the Eternal Father;
        and intellect that he might know, seeing Your goodness, and so might
        participate in the wisdom of Your only-begotten Son; and will, that he
        might love that which his intellect has seen and known of Your truth,
        thus participating in the clemency of Your Holy Spirit. What reason had
        You for creating man in such dignity? The inestimable love with which
        You saw Your creature in Yourself, and became enamored of him, for You
        created him through love, and destined him to be such that he might
        taste and enjoy Your Eternal Good. I see therefore that through his sin
        he lost this dignity in which You originally placed him, and by his
        rebellion against You, fell into a state of war with Your kindness, that
        is to say, we all became Your enemies. 
         "Therefore, You, moved by that same fire of love with which You
        created him, willingly gave man a means of reconciliation, so that after
        the great rebellion into which he had fallen, there should come a great
        peace; and so You gave him the only-begotten Word, Your Son, to be the
        Mediator between us and You. He was our Justice, for He took on Himself
        all our offenses and injustices, and performed Your obedience, Eternal
        Father, which You imposed on Him, when You clothed Him with our
        humanity, our human nature and likeness. Oh, abyss of love! What heart
        can help breaking when it sees such dignity as Yours descend to such
        lowliness as our humanity? We are Your image, and You have become ours,
        by this union which You have accomplished with man, veiling the Eternal
        Deity with the cloud of woe, and the corrupted clay of Adam. For what
        reason? -- Love. Wherefore, You, O God, have become man, and man has
        become God. By this ineffable love of Yours, therefore, I constrain You,
        and implore You that You do mercy to Your creatures." 
          
         How God grieves over the Christian people, and particularly over His
        ministers; and touches on the subject of the Sacrament of Christ's Body,
        and the benefit of the Incarnation. 
          
         Then God, turning the eye of His mercy towards her, allowing Himself
        to be constrained by her tears, and bound by the chain of her holy
        desire, replied with lamentation -- "My sweetest daughter, your
        tears constrain Me, because they are joined with My love, and fall for
        love of Me, and your painful desires force Me to answer you; but marvel,
        and see how My spouse has defiled her face, and become leprous, on
        account of her filthiness and self- love, and swollen with the pride and
        avarice of those who feed on their own sin. 
         "What I say of the universal body and the mystical body of the
        Holy Church (that is to say the Christian religion) I also say of My
        ministers, who stand and feed at the breasts of Holy Church; and, not
        only should they feed themselves, but it is also their duty to feed and
        hold to those breasts the universal body of Christian people, and also
        any other people who should wish to leave the darkness of their
        infidelity, and bind themselves as members to My Church. See then with
        what ignorance and darkness, and ingratitude, are administered, and with
        what filthy hands are handled this glorious milk and blood of My spouse,
        and with what presumption and irreverence they are received. Wherefore,
        that which really gives life, often gives, through the defects of those
        who receive it, death; that is to say, the precious Blood of My
        only-begotten Son, which destroyed death and darkness, and gave life and
        truth, and confounded falsehood. For I give this Blood and use It for
        salvation and perfection in the case of that man who disposes himself
        properly to receive it, for It gives life and adorns the soul with every
        grace, in proportion to the disposition and affection of him who
        receives It; similarly It gives death to him who receives It unworthily,
        living in iniquity and in the darkness of mortal sin; to him, I say, It
        gives death and not life; not through defect of the Blood, nor through
        defect of the minister, though there might be great evil in him, because
        his evil would not spoil nor defile the Blood nor diminish Its grace and
        virtue, nor does an evil minister do harm to him to whom he gives the
        Blood, but to himself he does the harm of guilt, which will be followed
        by punishment, unless he correct himself with contrition and repentance.
        I say then that the Blood does harm to him who receives it unworthily,
        not through defect of the Blood, nor of the minister, but through his
        own evil disposition and defect inasmuch as he has befouled his mind and
        body with such impurity and misery, and has been so cruel to himself and
        his neighbor. He has used cruelty to himself, depriving himself of
        grace, trampling under the feet of his affection the fruit of the Blood
        which he had received in Holy Baptism, when the stain of original sin
        was taken from him by virtue of the Blood, which stain he drew from his
        origin, when he was generated by his father and mother. 
         "Wherefore I gave My Word, My only-begotten Son, because the
        whole stuff of human generation was corrupted through the sin of the
        first man Adam. Wherefore, all of you, vessels made of this stuff, were
        corrupted and not disposed to the possession of eternal life -- so I,
        with My dignity, joined Myself to the baseness of your human generation,
        in order to restore it to grace which you had lost by sin; for I was
        incapable of suffering, and yet, on account of guilt, My divine justice
        demanded suffering. But man was not sufficient to satisfy it, for, even
        if he had satisfied to a certain extent, he could only have satisfied
        for himself, and not for other rational creatures, besides which,
        neither for himself, nor for others, could man satisfy, his sin having
        been committed against Me, who am the Infinite Good. Wishing, however,
        to restore man, who was enfeebled, and could not satisfy for the above
        reason, I sent My Word, My own Son, clothed in your own very nature, the
        corrupted clay of Adam, in order that He might endure suffering in that
        self-same nature in which man had offended, suffering in His body even
        to the opprobrious death of the Cross, and so He satisfied My justice
        and My divine mercy. For My mercy willed to make satisfaction for the
        sin of man and to dispose him to that good for which I had created him.
        This human nature, joined with the divine nature, was sufficient to
        satisfy for the whole human race, not only on account of the pain which
        it sustained in its finite nature, that is in the flesh of Adam, but by
        virtue of the Eternal Deity, the divine and infinite nature joined to
        it. The two natures being thus joined together, I received and accepted
        the sacrifice of My only-begotten Son, kneaded into one dough with the
        divine nature, by the fire of divine love which was the fetter which
        held him fastened and nailed to the Cross in this way. Thus human nature
        was sufficient to satisfy for guilt, but only by virtue of the divine
        nature. And in this way was destroyed the stain of Adam's sin, only the
        mark of it remaining behind, that is an inclination to sin, and to every
        sort of corporeal defect, like the cicatrice which remains when a man is
        healed of a wound. In this way the original fault of Adam was able still
        to cause a fatal stain; wherefore the coming of the great Physician,
        that is to say, of My only-begotten Son, cured this invalid, He drinking
        this bitter medicine, which man could not drink on account of his great
        weakness, like a foster- mother who takes medicine instead of her
        suckling, because she is grown up and strong, and the child is not fit
        to endure its bitterness. He was man's foster-mother, enduring, with the
        greatness and strength of the Deity united with your nature, the bitter
        medicine of the painful death of the Cross, to give life to you little
        ones debilitated by guilt. I say therefore that the mark alone of
        original sin remains, which sin you take from your father and your
        mother when you were generated by them. But this mark is removed from
        the soul, though not altogether, by Holy Baptism, which has the virtue
        of communicating the life of grace by means of that glorious and
        precious Blood. Wherefore, at the moment that the soul receives Holy
        Baptism, original sin is taken away from her, and grace is infused into
        her, and that inclination to sin, which remains from the original
        corruption, as has been said, is indeed a source of weakness, but the
        soul can keep the bridle on it if she choose. Then the vessel of the
        soul is disposed to receive and increase in herself grace, more or less,
        according as it pleases her to dispose herself willingly with affection,
        and desire of loving and serving Me; and, in the same way, she can
        dispose herself to evil as to good, in spite of her having received
        grace in Holy Baptism. Wherefore when the time of discretion is come,
        the soul can, by her free will, make choice either of good or evil,
        according as it pleases her will; and so great is this liberty that man
        has, and so strong has this liberty been made by virtue of this glorious
        Blood, that no demon or creature can constrain him to one smallest fault
        without his free consent. He has been redeemed from slavery, and made
        free in order that he might govern his own sensuality, and obtain the
        end for which he was created. Oh, miserable man, who delights to remain
        in the mud like a brute, and does not learn this great benefit which he
        has received from Me! A benefit so great, that the poor wretched
        creature full of such ignorance could receive no greater." 
          
         How sin is more gravely punished after the Passion of Christ than
        before; and how God promises to do mercy to the world, and to the Holy
        Church, by means of the prayers and sufferings of His servants. 
          
         "And I wish you to know, My daughter, that, although I have
        re-created and restored to the life of grace, the human race, through
        the Blood of My only-begotten Son, as I have said, men are not grateful,
        but, going from bad to worse, and from guilt to guilt, even persecuting
        Me with many injuries, taking so little account of the graces which I
        have given them, and continue to give them, that, not only do they not
        attribute what they have received to grace, but seem to themselves on
        occasion to receive injuries from Me, as if I desired anything else than
        their sanctification. 
         "I say to you that they will be more hard-hearted, and worthy of
        more punishment, and will, indeed, be punished more severely, now that
        they have received redemption in the Blood of My Son, than they would
        have been before that redemption took place -- that is, before the stain
        of Adam's sin had been taken away. It is right that he who receives more
        should render more, and should be under great obligations to Him from
        whom he receives more. 
         "Man, then, was closely bound to Me through his being which I
        have given him, creating him in My own image and similitude; for which
        reason, he was bound to render Me glory, but he deprived Me of it, and
        wished to give it to himself. Thus he came to transgress My obedience
        imposed on him, and became My enemy. And I, with My humility, destroyed
        his pride, humiliating the divine nature, and taking your humanity, and,
        freeing you from the service of the devil, I made you free. And, not
        only did I give you liberty, but, if you examine, you will see that man
        has become God, and God has become man, through the union of the divine
        with the human nature. This is the debt which they have incurred -- that
        is to say, the treasure of the Blood, by which they have been procreated
        to grace. See, therefore, how much more they owe after the redemption
        than before. For they are now obliged to render Me glory and praise by
        following in the steps of My Incarnate Word, My only-begotten Son, for
        then they repay Me the debt of love both of Myself and of their
        neighbor, with true and genuine virtue, as I have said to you above, and
        if they do not do it, the greater their debt, the greater will be the
        offense they fall into, and therefore, by divine justice, the greater
        their suffering in eternal damnation. 
         "A false Christian is punished more than a pagan, and the
        deathless fire of divine justice consumes him more, that is, afflicts
        him more, and, in his affliction, he feels himself being consumed by the
        worm of conscience, though, in truth, he is not consumed, because the
        damned do not lose their being through any torment which they receive.
        Wherefore I say to you, that they ask for death and cannot have it, for
        they cannot lose their being; the existence of grace they lose, through
        their fault, but not their natural existence. Therefore guilt is more
        gravely punished after the Redemption of the Blood than before, because
        man received more; but sinners neither seem to perceive this, nor to pay
        any attention to their own sins, and so become My enemies, though I have
        reconciled them, by means of the Blood of My Son. But there is a remedy
        with which I appease My wrath -- that is to say, by means of My
        servants, if they are jealous to constrain Me by their desire. You see,
        therefore, that you have bound Me with this bond which I have given you,
        because I wished to do mercy to the world. "Therefore I give My
        servants hunger and desire for My honor, and the salvation of souls, so
        that, constrained by their tears, I may mitigate the fury of My divine
        justice. Take, therefore, your tears and your sweat, drawn from the
        fountain of My divine love, and, with them, wash the face of My spouse. 
         "I promise you, that, by this means, her beauty will be restored
        to her, not by the knife nor by cruelty, but peacefully, by humble and
        continued prayer, by the sweat and the tears shed by the fiery desire of
        My servants, and thus will I fulfill your desire if you, on your part,
        endure much, casting the light of your patience into the darkness of
        perverse man, not fearing the world's persecutions, for I will protect
        you, and My Providence shall never fail you in the slightest need." 
          
         How the road to Heaven being broken through the disobedience of Adam,
        God made of His Son a Bridge by which man could pass. 
          
         "Wherefore I have told you that I have made a Bridge of My Word,
        of My only-begotten Son, and this is the truth. I wish that you, My
        children, should know that the road was broken by the sin and
        disobedience of Adam, in such a way, that no one could arrive at Eternal
        Life. Wherefore men did not render Me glory in the way in which they
        ought to have, as they did not participate in that Good for which I had
        created them, and My truth was not fulfilled. This truth is that I have
        created man to My own image and similitude, in order that he might have
        Eternal Life, and might partake of Me, and taste My supreme and eternal
        sweetness and goodness. But, after sin had closed Heaven and bolted the
        doors of mercy, the soul of man produced thorns and prickly brambles,
        and My creature found in himself rebellion against himself. 
         "And the flesh immediately began to war against the Spirit, and,
        losing the state of innocence, became a foul animal, and all created
        things rebelled against man, whereas they would have been obedient to
        him, had he remained in the state in which I had placed him. He, not
        remaining therein, transgressed My obedience, and merited eternal death
        in soul and body. And, as soon as he had sinned, a tempestuous flood
        arose, which ever buffets him with its waves, bringing him weariness and
        trouble from himself, the devil, and the world. Every one was drowned in
        the flood, because no one, with his own justice alone, could arrive at
        Eternal Life. And so, wishing to remedy your great evils, I have given
        you the Bridge of My Son, in order that, passing across the flood, you
        may not be drowned, which flood is the tempestuous sea of this dark
        life. See, therefore, under what obligations the creature is to Me, and
        how ignorant he is, not to take the remedy which I have offered, but to
        be willing to drown." 
          
         How God induces the soul to look at the greatness of this Bridge,
        inasmuch as it reaches from earth to Heaven. 
          
         "Open, my daughter, the eye of your intellect, and you will see
        the accepted and the ignorant, the imperfect, and also the perfect who
        follow Me in truth, so that you may grieve over the damnation of the
        ignorant, and rejoice over the perfection of My beloved servants. 
         "You will see further how those bear themselves who walk in the
        light, and those who walk in the darkness. I also wish you to look at
        the Bridge of My only-begotten Son, and see the greatness thereof, for
        it reaches from Heaven to earth, that is, that the earth of your
        humanity is joined to the greatness of the Deity thereby. I say then
        that this Bridge reaches from Heaven to earth, and constitutes the union
        which I have made with man. 
         "This was necessary, in order to reform the road which was
        broken, as I said to you, in order that man should pass through the
        bitterness of the world, and arrive at life; but the Bridge could not be
        made of earth sufficiently large to span the flood and give you Eternal
        Life, because the earth of human nature was not sufficient to satisfy
        for guilt, to remove the stain of Adam's sin. Which stain corrupted the
        whole human race and gave out a stench, as I have said to you above. It
        was, therefore, necessary to join human nature with the height of My
        nature, the Eternal Deity, so that it might be sufficient to satisfy for
        the whole human race, so that human nature should sustain the
        punishment, and that the Divine nature, united with the human, should
        make acceptable the sacrifice of My only Son, offered to Me to take
        death from you and to give you life. 
         "So the height of the Divinity, humbled to the earth, and joined
        with your humanity, made the Bridge and reformed the road. Why was this
        done? In order that man might come to his true happiness with the
        angels. And observe, that it is not enough, in order that you should
        have life, that My Son should have made you this Bridge, unless you walk
        thereon." 
          
         How this soul prays God to show her those who cross by the aforesaid
        Bridge, and those who do not. 
          
         Then this soul exclaimed with ardent love, -- "Oh, inestimable
        Charity, sweet above all sweetness! Who would not be inflamed by such
        great love? What heart can help breaking at such tenderness? It seems,
        oh, Abyss of Charity, as if you were mad with love of Your creature, as
        if You could not live without him, and yet You are our God who have no
        heed of us, Your greatness does not increase through our good, for You
        are unchangeable, and our evil causes You no harm, for You are the
        Supreme and Eternal Goodness. What moves You to do us such mercy through
        pure love, and on account of no debt that You owed us, or need that You
        had of us? We are rather Your guilty and malignant debtors. Wherefore,
        if I understand aright, Oh, Supreme and Eternal Truth, I am the thief
        and You have been punished for me. For I see Your Word, Your Son,
        fastened and nailed to the Cross, of which You have made me a Bridge, as
        You have shown me, Your miserable servant, for which reason, my heart is
        bursting, and yet cannot burst, through the hunger and the desire which
        it has conceived towards You. I remember, my Lord, that You were willing
        to show me who are those who go by the Bridge and those who do not;
        should it please Your goodness to manifest this to me, willingly would I
        see and hear it." 
          
         How this Bridge has three steps, which signify the three states of
        the soul; and how, being lifted on high, yet it is not separated from
        the earth; and how these words are to be understood: "If I am
        lifted up from the earth, I will draw all things unto Me." 
          
         Then the Eternal God, to enamor and excite that soul still more for
        the salvation of souls, replied to her, and said: "First, as I have
        shown you that for which you wished, and ask Me, I will now explain to
        you the nature of this Bridge. I have told you, My daughter, that the
        Bridge reaches from Heaven to earth; this is through the union which I
        have made with man, whom I formed of the clay of the earth. Now learn
        that this Bridge, My only-begotten Son, has three steps, of which two
        were made with the wood of the most Holy Cross, and the third still
        retains the great bitterness He tasted, when He was given gall and
        vinegar to drink. In these three steps you will recognize three states
        of the soul, which I will explain to you below. The feet of the soul,
        signifying her affection, are the first step, for the feet carry the
        body as the affection carries the soul. Wherefore these pierced Feet are
        steps by which you can arrive at His Side, Which manifests to you the
        secret of His Heart, because the soul, rising on the steps of her
        affection, commences to taste the love of His Heart, gazing into that
        open Heart of My Son, with the eye of the intellect, and finds It
        consumed with ineffable love. I say consumed, because He does not love
        you for His own profit, because you can be of no profit to Him, He being
        one and the same thing with Me. Then the soul is filled with love,
        seeing herself so much loved. Having passed the second step, the soul
        reaches out to the third -- that is -- to the Mouth, where she finds
        peace from the terrible war she has been waging with her sin. On the
        first step, then, lifting her feet from the affections of the earth, the
        soul strips herself of vice; on the second she fills herself with love
        and virtue; and on the third she tastes peace. So the Bridge has three
        steps, in order that, climbing past the first and the second, you may
        reach the last, which is lifted on high, so that the water, running
        beneath, may not touch it; for, in My Son, was no venom of sin. This
        Bridge is lifted on high, and yet, at the same time, joined to the
        earth. Do you know when it was lifted on high? When My Son was lifted up
        on the wood of the most Holy Cross, the Divine nature remaining joined
        to the lowliness of the earth of your humanity. 
         "For this reason I said to you that, being lifted on high, He
        was not lifted out of the earth, for the Divine nature is united and
        kneaded into one thing with it. And there was no one who could go on the
        Bridge until It had been lifted on high, wherefore He said, --  'Si
        exaltatus fuero a terra omnia traham ad me ipsum,'  that is, 'If I am
        lifted on high I will draw all things to Me.' My Goodness, seeing that
        in no other way could you be drawn to Me, I sent Him in order that He
        should be lifted on high on the wood of the Cross, making of it an anvil
        on which My Son, born of human generation, should be re-made, in order
        to free you from death, and to restore you to the life of grace;
        wherefore He drew everything to Himself by this means, namely, by
        showing the ineffable love, with which I love you, the heart of man
        being always attracted by love. Greater love, then, I could not show
        you, than to lay down My life for you; perforce, then, My Son was
        treated in this way by love, in order that ignorant man should be unable
        to resist being drawn to Me. 
         "In very truth, then, My Son said, that, being lifted on high,
        He would draw all things to Him. And this is to be understood in two
        ways. Firstly, that, when the heart of man is drawn by the affection of
        love, as I have said, it is drawn together with all the powers of his
        soul, that is, with the Memory, the Intellect, and the Will; now, when
        these three powers are harmoniously joined together in My Name, all the
        other operations which the man performs, whether in deed or thought, are
        pleasing, and joined together by the effect of love, because love is
        lifted on high, following the Sorrowful Crucified One; so My Truth said
        well, 'If I am lifted on high,' &amp;c., meaning, that if the heart and
        the powers of the soul are drawn to Him, all the actions are also drawn
        to Him. Secondly, everything has been created for the service of man, to
        serve the necessities of rational creatures, and the rational creature
        has not been made for them, but for Me, in order to serve Me with all
        his heart, and with all his affection. See, then, that man being drawn,
        everything else is drawn with him, because everything else has been made
        for him. It was therefore necessary that the Bridge should be lifted on
        high, and have steps, in order that it might be climbed with greater
        facility." 
          
         How this Bridge is built of stones which signify virtues; and how on
        the Bridge is a hostelry where food is given to the travelers; and how
        he who goes over the Bridge goes to life, while he who goes under It
        goes to perdition and death. 
          
         "This Bridge is built of stones, so that, if the rain come, it
        may not impede the traveler. Do you know what these stones are? They are
        the stones of true and sincere virtues. These stones were not built into
        the walls before the Passion of My Son, and therefore even those who
        attempted to walk by the road of virtue were prevented from arriving at
        their journey's end, because Heaven was not yet unlocked with the key of
        the Blood, and the rain of Justice did not let them pass; but, after the
        stones were made, and built up on the Body of My sweet Son, My Word, of
        whom I have spoken to you, He, who was Himself the Bridge, moistened the
        mortar for its building with His Blood. That is, His Blood was united
        with the mortar of divinity, and with the fortitude, and the fire of
        love; and, by My power, these stones of the virtues were built into a
        wall, upon Him as the foundation, for there is no virtue which has not
        been proved in Him, and from Him all virtues have their life. Wherefore
        no one can have the virtue given by a life of grace, but from Him, that
        is, without following the footsteps of His doctrine. He has built a wall
        of the virtues, planting them as living stones, and cementing them with
        His Blood, so that every believer may walk speedily, and without any
        servile fear of the rain of Divine justice, for he is sheltered by the
        mercy which descended from Heaven in the Incarnation of this My Son. How
        was Heaven opened? With the key of His Blood; so you see that the Bridge
        is walled and roofed with Mercy. His also is the Hostelry in the Garden
        of the Holy Church, which keeps and ministers the Bread of Life, and
        gives to drink of the Blood, so that My creatures, journeying on their
        pilgrimage, may not, through weariness, faint by the way; and for this
        reason My love has ordained that the Blood and the Body of My
        only-begotten Son, wholly God and wholly man, may be ministered to you.
        The pilgrim, having passed the Bridge, arrives at the door which is part
        of the Bridge, at which all must enter, wherefore He says: 'I am the
        Way, the Truth, and the Life, he who follows Me does not walk in
        darkness, but in light.' And in another place My Truth says, 'That no
        man can come to Me if not by Him,' and so indeed it is. Therefore He
        says of Himself that He is the Road, and this is the truth, and I have
        already shown you that He is a Road in the form of the Bridge. And He
        says that He is the Truth, and so He is, because He is united with Me
        who am the Truth, and he who follows Him, walks in the Truth, and in
        Life, because he who follows this Truth receives the life of grace, and
        cannot faint from hunger, because the Truth has become your food, nor
        fall in the darkness, because He is light without any falsehood. And,
        with that Truth, He confounded and destroyed the lie that the Devil told
        to Eve, with which he broke up the road to Heaven, and the Truth brought
        the pieces together again, and cemented them with His Blood. Wherefore,
        those who follow this road are the sons of the Truth, because they
        follow the Truth, and pass through the door of Truth and find themselves
        united to Me, who am the Door and the Road and at the same time Infinite
        Peace. 
         "But he, who walks not on this road, goes under the Bridge, in
        the river where there are no stones, only water, and since there are no
        supports in the water, no one can travel that way without drowning; thus
        have come to pass the sins, and the condition of the world. Wherefore,
        if the affection is not placed on the stones, but is placed, with
        disordinate love, on creatures, loving them, and being kept by them far
        from Me, the soul drowns, for creatures are like water that continually
        runs past, and man also passes continually like the river, although it
        seems to him that he stands still and the creatures that he loves pass
        by, and yet he is passing himself continually to the end of his journey
        -- death! And he would gladly retain himself (that is his life, and the
        things that he loves), but he does not succeed, either, through death,
        by which he has to leave them, or through my disposition, by which these
        created things are taken from the sight of My creatures. Such as these
        follow a lie, walking on the road of falsehood, and are sons of the
        Devil, who is the Father of Lies; and, because they pass by the door of
        falsehood, they receive eternal damnation. So then you see, that I have
        shown you both Truth and Falsehood, that is, My road which is Truth, and
        the Devil's which is Falsehood." 
          
         How traveling on both of these roads, that is the Bridge and the
        River, is fatiguing; and of the delight which the soul feels in
        traveling by the Bridge. 
          
         "These are the two roads, and both are hard to travel. Wonder,
        then, at the ignorance and blindness of man, who, having a Road made for
        him, which causes such delight to those who use It, that every
        bitterness becomes sweet, and every burden light, yet prefers to walk
        over the water. For those who cross by the Bridge, being still in the
        darkness of the body, find light, and, being mortal, find immortal life,
        tasting, through love, the light of Eternal Truth which promises
        refreshment to him who wearies himself for Me, who am grateful and just,
        and render to every man according as he deserves. Wherefore every good
        deed is rewarded, and every fault is punished. The tongue would not be
        sufficient to relate the delight felt by him who goes on this road, for,
        even in this life, he tastes and participates in that good which has
        been prepared for him in eternal life. He, therefore, is a fool indeed,
        who despises so great a good, and chooses rather to receive in this
        life, the earnest money of Hell, walking by the lower road with great
        toil, and without any refreshment or advantage. Wherefore, through their
        sins, they are deprived of Me, who am the Supreme and Eternal Good.
        Truly then have you reason for grief, and I will that you and My other
        servants remain in continual bitterness of soul at the offense done to
        Me, and in compassion for the ignorant, and the loss of those who, in
        their ignorance, thus offend Me. Now you have seen and heard about this
        Bridge, how it is, and this I have told you in order to explain My
        words, that My only-begotten Son was a Bridge.   And thus, you see
        that He is the Truth, made in the way that I have shown you, that is --
        by the union of height and lowliness."     
          
         How this Bridge, having reached to Heaven on the day of the
        Ascension, did not for that reason have the earth. 
         "When My only-begotten Son returned to Me, forty days after the
        resurrection, this Bridge, namely Himself, arose from the earth, that
        is, from among the conversation of men, and ascended into Heaven by
        virtue of the Divine Nature and sat at the right hand of Me, the Eternal
        Father, as the angels said, on the day of the Ascension, to the
        disciples, standing like dead men, their hearts lifted on high, and
        ascended into Heaven with the wisdom of My Son -- 'Do not stand here any
        longer, for He is seated at the right hand of the Father!' When He,
        then, had thus ascended on high, and returned to Me the Father, I sent
        the Master, that is the Holy Spirit, who came to you with My power and
        the wisdom of My Son, and with His own clemency, which is the essence of
        the Holy Spirit. He is one thing with Me, the Father, and with My Son.
        And He built up the road of the doctrine which My Truth had left in the
        world. Thus, though the bodily presence of My Son left you, His doctrine
        remained, and the virtue of the stones founded upon this doctrine, which
        is the way made for you by this Bridge. For first, He practiced this
        doctrine and made the road by His actions, giving you His doctrine by
        example rather than by words; for He practiced, first Himself, what He
        afterwards taught you, then the clemency of the Holy Spirit made you
        certain of the doctrine, fortifying the minds of the disciples to
        confess the truth, and to announce this road, that is, the doctrine of
        Christ crucified, reproving, by this means, the world of its injustice
        and false judgment, of which injustice and false judgment, I will in
        time discourse to you at greater length. 
         "This much I have said to you in order that there might be no
        cloud of darkness in the mind of your hearers, that is, that they may
        know that of this Body of Christ I made a Bridge by the union of the
        divine with the human nature, for this is the truth. 
         "This Bridge, taking its point of departure in you, rose into
        Heaven, and was the one road which was taught you by the example and
        life of the Truth. What has now remained of all this, and where is the
        road to be found? I will tell you, that is, I will rather tell those who
        might fall into ignorance on this point. I tell you that this way of His
        doctrine, of which I have spoken to you, confirmed by the Apostles,
        declared by the blood of the martyrs, illuminated by the light of
        doctors, confessed by the confessors, narrated in all its love by the
        Evangelists, all of whom stand as witnesses to confess the Truth, is
        found in the mystical body of the Holy Church. These witnesses are like
        the light placed on a candlestick, to show forth the way of the Truth
        which leads to life with a perfect light, as I have said to you, and, as
        they themselves say to you, with proof, since they have proved in their
        own cases, that every person may, if he will, be illuminated to know the
        Truth, unless he choose to deprive his reason of light by his inordinate
        self-love. It is, indeed, the truth that His doctrine is true, and has
        remained like a lifeboat to draw the soul out of the tempestuous sea and
        to conduct her to the port of salvation. 
         "Wherefore, first I gave you the Bridge of My Son living and
        conversing in very deed amongst men, and when He, the living Bridge,
        left you, there remained the Bridge and the road of His doctrine, as has
        been said, His doctrine being joined with My power and with His wisdom,
        and with the clemency of the Holy Spirit. This power of Mine gives the
        virtue of fortitude to whoever follows this road, wisdom gives him
        light, so that, in this road, he may recognize the truth, and the Holy
        Spirit gives him love, which consumes and takes away all sensitive love
        out of the soul, leaving there only the love of virtue. Thus, in both
        ways, both actually and through His doctrine, He is the Way, the Truth,
        and the Life; that is, the Bridge which leads you to the height of
        Heaven. This is what He meant when He said, 'I came from the Father, and
        I return to the Father, and shall return to you'; that is to say, 'My
        Father sent Me to you, and made Me your Bridge, so that you might be
        saved from the river and attain to life.' Then He says, 'I will return
        to you, I will not leave you orphans, but will send you the Paraclete'
        -- as if My Truth should say, 'I will go to the Father and return; that
        is, that when the Holy Spirit shall come, who is called the Paraclete,
        He will show you more clearly, and will confirm you in the way of truth,
        that I have given you.' He said that He would return, and He did return,
        because the Holy Spirit came not alone, but with the power of the
        Father, and the wisdom of the Son, and the clemency of His own Essence. 
         "See then how He returns, not in actual flesh and blood, but, as
        I have said, building the road of His doctrine, with His power, which
        road cannot be destroyed or taken away from him who wishes to follow it,
        because it is firm and stable, and proceeds from Me, who am immovable. 
         "Manfully, then, should you follow this road, without any cloud
        of doubt, but with the light of faith which has been given you as a
        principle in Holy Baptism. 
         "Now I have fully shown to you the Bridge as it actually is, and
        the doctrine, which is one and the same thing with it. And I have shown
        it to the ignorant, in order that they may see where this road of Truth
        is, and where stand those who teach it; and I have explained that they
        are the Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, Evangelists, and Holy Doctors,
        placed like lanterns in the Holy Church. 
         "And I have shown how My Son, returning to Me, none the less,
        returned to you, not in His bodily presence, but by His power, when the
        Holy Spirit came upon the disciples, as I have said. For in His bodily
        presence He will not return until the last Day of Judgment, when He will
        come again with My Majesty and Divine Power to judge the world, to
        render good to the virtuous, and reward them for their labors, both in
        body and soul, and to dispense the evil of eternal death to those who
        have lived wickedly in the world. 
         "And now I wish to tell you that which I, the Truth, promised
        you, that is, to show you the perfect, the imperfect, and the supremely
        perfect; and the wicked, who, through their iniquities, drown in the
        river, attaining to punishment and torment; wherefore I say to you, My
        dearest sons, walk over the Bridge, and not underneath it, because
        underneath is not the way of truth, but the way of falsehood, by which
        walk the wicked, of whom I will presently speak to you. These are those
        sinners for whom I beg you to pray to Me, and for whom I ask in addition
        your tears and sweat, in order that they may receive mercy from
        Me." 
          
         How this soul wondering at the mercy of God, relates many gifts and
        graces given to the human race. 
          
         Then this soul, as it were, like one intoxicated, could not contain
        herself, but standing before the face of God, exclaimed, "How great
        is the Eternal Mercy with which You cover the sins of Your creatures! I
        do not wonder that You say of those who abandon mortal sin and return to
        You, 'I do not remember that you have ever offended Me.' Oh, ineffable
        Mercy! I do not wonder that You say this to those who are converted,
        when You say of those who persecute You, 'I wish you to pray for such,
        in order that I may do them mercy.' Oh, Mercy, who proceeds from Your
        Eternal Father, the Divinity who governs with Your power the whole
        world, by You were we created, in You were we re-created in the Blood of
        Your Son. Your Mercy preserves us, Your Mercy caused Your Son to do
        battle for us, hanging by His arms on the wood of the Cross, life and
        death battling together; then life confounded the death of our sin, and
        the death of our sin destroyed the bodily life of the Immaculate Lamb.
        Which was finally conquered? Death! By what means? Mercy! Your Mercy
        gives light and life, by which Your clemency is known in all Your
        creatures, both the just and the unjust. In the height of Heaven Your
        Mercy shines, that is, in Your saints. If I turn to the earth, it
        abounds with Your Mercy. In the darkness of Hell Your Mercy shines, for
        the damned do not receive the pains they deserve; with Your Mercy You
        temper Justice. By Mercy You have washed us in the Blood, and by Mercy
        You wish to converse with Your creatures. Oh, Loving Madman! was it not
        enough for You to become Incarnate, that You must also die? Was not
        death enough, that You must also descend into Limbo, taking thence the
        holy fathers to fulfill Your Mercy and Your Truth in them? Because Your
        goodness promises a reward to them that serve You in truth, You
        descended to Limbo, to withdraw from their pain Your servants, and give
        them the fruit of their labors. Your Mercy constrains You to give even
        more to man, namely, to leave Yourself to him in food, so that we, weak
        ones, should have comfort, and the ignorant commemorating You, should
        not lose the memory of Your benefits. Wherefore every day You give
        Yourself to man, representing Yourself in the Sacrament of the Altar, in
        the body of Your Holy Church. What has done this? Your Mercy. Oh, Divine
        Mercy! My heart suffocates in thinking of you, for on every side to
        which I turn my thought, I find nothing but mercy. Oh, Eternal Father!
        Forgive my ignorance, that I presume thus to chatter to You, but the
        love of Your Mercy will be my excuse before the Face of Your
        loving-kindness." 
          
         Of the baseness of those who pass by the river under the Bridge; and
        how the soul, that passes underneath, is called by God the tree of
        death, whose roots are held in four vices. 
          
         After this soul had refreshed a little her heart in the mercy of God,
        by these words, she humbly waited for the fulfillment of the promise
        made to her, and God continuing His discourse said: "Dearest
        daughter, you have spoken before Me of My mercy, because I gave it you
        to taste and to see in the word which I spoke to you when I said: 'these
        are those for whom I pray you to intercede with Me,' but know, that My
        mercy is without any comparison, far more than you can see, because your
        sight is imperfect, and My mercy perfect and infinite, so that there can
        be no comparison between the two, except what may be between a finite
        and an infinite thing. But I have wished that you should taste this
        mercy, and also the dignity of man, which I have shown you above, so
        that you might know better the cruelty of those wicked men who travel
        below the Bridge. Open the eye of your intellect, and wonder at those
        who voluntarily drown themselves, and at the baseness to which they are
        fallen by their fault, from which cause, they have first become weak,
        and this was when they conceived mortal sin in their minds, for they
        then bring it forth, and lose the life of grace. And, as a corpse which
        can have no feeling or movement of itself, but only when it is moved and
        lifted by others, so those, who are drowned in the stream of disordinate
        love of the world, are dead to grace. Wherefore because they are dead
        their memory takes no heed of My mercy. The eye of their intellect sees
        not and knows not My Truth, because their feeling is dead, that is,
        their intellect has no object before it but themselves, with the dead
        love of their own sensuality, and so their will is dead to My will
        because it loves nothing but dead things. These three powers then being
        dead, all the soul's operations both in deed and thought are dead as far
        as grace is concerned. For the soul cannot defend herself against her
        enemies, nor help herself through her own power, but only so far as she
        is helped by Me. It is true indeed, that every time that this corpse, in
        whom only free-will has remained (which remains as long as the mortal
        body lives), asks My help, he can have it, but never can he help
        himself; he has become insupportable to himself, and, wishing to govern
        the world, is governed by that which is not, that is by sin, for sin in
        itself is nothing, and such men have become the servants and slaves of
        sin. I have made them trees of love with the life of grace which they
        received in Holy Baptism; and they have become trees of death, because
        they are dead, as I have already said to you. Do you know how this tree
        finds such roots? In the height of pride, which is nourished by their
        own sensitive self-love. Its branch is their own impatience, and its
        offshoot indiscretion: these are the four principal vices which destroy
        the soul of him who is a tree of death, because he has not drawn life
        from grace. Inside the tree is nourished the worm of conscience, which,
        while man lives in mortal sin, is blinded by self-love, and therefore
        felt but little; the fruits of this tree are mortal, for they have drawn
        their nourishment, which should have been humility, from the roots of
        pride, and the miserable soul is full of ingratitude, whence proceeds
        every evil. But if she were grateful for the benefits she has received,
        she would know Me, and knowing Me would know herself, and so would
        remain in My love: but she, as if blind, goes groping down the river,
        and she does not see that the water does not support her." 
          
         How the fruits of this tree are as diverse as are the sins; and
        first, of the sin of sensuality. 
          
         "The fruits of this death-giving tree, are as diverse as sins
        are diverse. See that some of these fruits are the food of beasts who
        live impurely, using their body and their mind like a swine who wallows
        in mud, for in the same way they wallow in the mire of sensuality. Oh,
        ugly soul, where have you left your dignity? You were made sister to the
        angels, and now you are become a brute beast. To such misery come
        sinners, notwithstanding that they are sustained by Me, who am Supreme
        Purity, notwithstanding that the very devils, whose friends and servants
        they have become, cannot endure the sight of such filthy actions.
        Neither does any sin, abominable as it may be, take away the light of
        the intellect from man, so much as does this one. This the philosophers
        knew, not by the light of grace, because they had it not, but because
        nature gave them the light to know that this sin obscured the intellect,
        and for that reason they preserved themselves in continence the better
        to study. Thus also they flung away their riches in order that the
        thought of them should not occupy their heart. Not so does the ignorant
        and false Christian, who has lost grace by sin." 
          
         How the fruit of others is avarice; and of the evils that proceed
        from it. 
          
         "A fruit of the earth belongs to some others, who are covetous
        misers, acting like the mole, who always feeds on earth till death, and
        when they arrive at death they find no remedy. Such as these, with their
        meanness, despise My generosity, selling time to their neighbor. They
        are cruel usurers, and robbers of their neighbor; because in their
        memory they have not the remembrance of My mercy, for if they had it
        they would not be cruel to themselves or to their neighbor; on the
        contrary, they would be compassionate and merciful to themselves,
        practicing the virtues on their neighbor and succoring him charitably.
        Oh, how many are the evils that come of this cursed sin of avarice, how
        many homicides and thefts, and how much pillage with unlawful gain, and
        cruelty of heart and injustice! It kills the soul and makes her the
        slave of riches, so that she cares not to observe My commandments. 
         "A miser loves no one except for his own profit. Avarice
        proceeds from and feeds pride, the one follows from the other, because
        the miser always carries with him the thought of his own reputation, and
        thus avarice, which is immediately combined with pride, full of its own
        opinions, goes on from bad to worse. It is a fire which always
        germinates the smoke of vainglory and vanity of heart, and boasting in
        that which does not belong to it. It is a root which has many branches,
        and the principal one is that which makes a man care for his own
        reputation, from whence proceeds his desire to be greater than his
        neighbor. It also brings forth the deceitful heart that is neither pure
        nor liberal, but is double, making a man show one thing with his tongue,
        while he has another in his heart, and making him conceal the truth and
        tell lies for his own profit. And it produces envy, which is a worm that
        is always gnawing, and does not let the miser have any happiness out of
        his own or others' good. How will these wicked ones in so wretched a
        state give of their substance to the poor, when they rob others? How
        will they draw their foul soul out of the mire, when they themselves put
        it there? Sometimes even do they become so brutish, that they do not
        consider their children and relations, and cause them to fall with them
        into great misery. And, nevertheless, in My mercy I sustain them, I do
        not command the earth to swallow them up, that they may repent of their
        sins. Would they then give their life for the salvation of souls, when
        they will not give their substance? Would they give their affections
        when they are gnawed with envy? Oh, miserable vices that destroy the
        heaven of the soul. Heaven I call her (the soul) because so I made her,
        living in her at first by grace, and hiding Myself within her, and
        making of her a mansion through affection of love. Now she has separated
        herself from Me, like an adulteress, loving herself, and creatures more
        than Me, and has made a god of herself, persecuting Me with many and
        diverse sins. And this she does because she does not consider the
        benefit of the Blood that was shed with so great Fire of Love." 
          
         How some others hold positions of authority, and bring forth fruits
        of injustice. 
          
         "There are others who hold their heads high by their position of
        authority, and who bear the banner of injustice -- using injustice
        against Me, God, and against their neighbor, and against themselves --
        to themselves by not paying the debt of virtue, and towards Me by not
        paying the debt of honor in glorifying and praising My Name, which debt
        they are bound to pay. But they, like thieves, steal what is Mine, and
        give it to the service of their own sensuality. So that they commit
        injustice towards Me and towards themselves, like blind and ignorant men
        who do not recognize Me in themselves on account of self-love, like the
        Jews and the ministers of the Law who, with envy and self-love, blinded
        themselves so that they did not recognize the Truth, My only- begotten
        Son, and rendered not His due to the Eternal Truth, who was amongst
        them, as said My Truth: 'The Kingdom of God is among you.' But they knew
        it not, because, in the aforesaid way, they had lost the light of
        reason, and so they did not pay their debt of honor and glory to Me, and
        to Him, who was one thing with Me, and like blind ones committed
        injustice, persecuting Him with much ignominy, even to the death of the
        Cross. 
         "Thus are such as these unjust to themselves, to Me, and to
        their neighbor, unjustly selling the flesh of their dependents, and of
        any person who falls into their hands." 
          
         How through these and through other defects, one falls into false
        judgment; and of the indignity to which one comes. 
          
         "By these and by other sins men fall into false judgment, as I
        will explain to you below. They are continually being scandalized by My
        works, which are all just, and all performed in truth through love and
        mercy. With this false judgment, and with the poison of envy and pride,
        the works of My Son were slandered and unjustly judged, and with lies
        did His enemies say: 'This man works by virtue of Beelzebub.' Thus
        wicked men, standing in self- love, impurity, pride, and avarice, and
        founded in envy, and in perverse rashness with impatience, are forever
        scandalized at Me and at My servants, whom they judge to be feignedly
        practicing the virtues, because their heart is rotten, and, having
        spoiled their taste, good things seem evil to them, and bad things, that
        is to say disorderly living, seem good to them. Oh, how blind is the
        human generation in that it considers not its own dignity! From being
        great you have become small, from a ruler you have become a slave, and
        that in the vilest service that can be had, because you are the servant
        and slave of sin, and are become like unto that which you do serve. 
         "Sin is nothing. You, then, have become nothing; it has deprived
        you of life, and given you death. This life and power were given you by
        the Word, My only-begotten Son, the glorious Bridge, He drawing you from
        out of your servitude when you were servants of the devil, Himself
        becoming as a servant to take you out of servitude, imposing on Himself
        obedience to do away the disobedience of Adam, and humbling Himself to
        the shameful death of the Cross to confound pride. By His death He
        destroyed every vice, so that no one could say that any vice remained
        that was not punished and beaten out with pains, as I said to you above,
        when I said that of His Body He had made an anvil. All the remedies are
        ready to save men from eternal death, and they despise the Blood, and
        have trampled It under the feet of their disordinate affection; and it
        is for this injustice and false judgment that the world is reproved, and
        will be reproved on the Last Day of Judgment. 
         "This was meant by My Truth when He said: 'I will send the
        Paraclete, who will reprove the world of injustice and false judgment.'
        And it was reproved when I sent the Holy Spirit on the Apostles." 
          
         Of the words that Christ said: "I will send the Holy Spirit, who
        will reprove the world of injustice and of false judgment;" and how
        one of these reproofs is continuous. 
          
         "There are three reproofs. One was given when the Holy Spirit
        came upon the disciples, who, as it is said, being fortified by My
        power, and illuminated by the wisdom of My beloved Son, received all in
        the plenitude of the Holy Spirit. Then the Holy Spirit, who is one thing
        with Me and with My Son, reproved the world by the mouth of the
        Apostles, with the doctrine of My Truth. They and all others, who are
        descended from them, following the truth which they understand through
        the same means, reprove the world. 
         "This is that continuous reproof that I make to the world by
        means of the Holy Scriptures, and My servants, putting the Holy Spirit
        on their tongues to announce My truth, even as the Devil puts himself on
        the tongues of his servants, that is to say, of those who pass through
        the river in iniquity. This is that sweet reproof that I have fixed
        forever, in the aforesaid way, out of My most great affection of love
        for the salvation of souls. And they cannot say 'I had no one who
        reproved me,' because the truth is revealed to them showing them vice
        and virtue. And I have made them see the fruit of virtue, and the
        hurtfulness of vice, to give them love and holy fear with hatred of vice
        and love of virtue, and this truth has not been shown them by an angel,
        so that they cannot say, 'the angel is a blessed spirit who cannot
        offend, and feels not the vexations of the flesh as we do, neither the
        heaviness of our body,' because the Incarnate Word of My Truth has been
        given to them with your mortal flesh. 
         "Who were the others who followed this Word? Mortal creatures,
        susceptible of pain like you, having the same opposition of the flesh to
        the Spirit, as had the glorious Paul, My standard-bearer, and many other
        saints who, by one thing or another, have been tormented. Which torments
        I permitted for the increase of grace and virtue in their souls. Thus,
        they were born in sin like you, and nourished with a like food, and I am
        God now as then. My power is not weakened, and cannot become weak. So
        that I can and will succor him who wishes to be succored by Me. Man
        wants My succor when he comes out of the river, and walks by the Bridge,
        following the doctrine of My Truth. Thus no one has any excuse, because
        both reproof and truth are constantly given to them. Wherefore, if they
        do not amend while they have time, they will be condemned by the second
        condemnation which will take place at the extremity of death, when My
        Justice will cry to them, 'Rise, you dead, and come to judgment!' That
        is to say, 'You, who are dead to grace, and have reached the moment of
        your corporal death, arise and come before the Supreme Judge with your
        injustice and false judgment, and with the extinguished light of faith
        which you received burning in Holy Baptism (and which you have blown out
        with the wind of pride), and with the vanity of your heart, with which
        you set your sails to winds which were contrary to your salvation, for
        with the wind of self-esteem, you filled the sail of self-love.' Thus
        you hastened down the stream of the delights and dignities of the world
        at your own will, following your fragile flesh and the temptations of
        the devil, who, with the sail of your own will set, has led you along
        the underway which is a running stream, and so has brought you with
        himself to eternal damnation." 
          
         Of the second reproof of injustice, and of false judgment, in general
        and in particular. 
          
         "This second reproof, dearest daughter, is indeed a
        condemnation, for the soul has arrived at the end, where there can be no
        remedy, for she is at the extremity of death, where is the worm of
        conscience, which I told you was blinded self-love. Now at the time of
        death, since she cannot get out of My hands, she begins to see, and
        therefore is gnawed with remorse, seeing that her own sin has brought
        her into so great evil. But if the soul have light to know and grieve
        for her fault, not on account of the pain of Hell that follows upon it,
        but on account of pain at her offense against Me, who am Supreme and
        Eternal Good, still she can find mercy. But if she pass the Bridge of
        death without light, and alone, with the worm of conscience, without the
        hope of the Blood, and bewailing herself more on account of her first
        condemnation than on account of My displeasure, she arrives at eternal
        damnation. And then she is reproved cruelly by My Justice of injustice
        and of false judgment, and not so much of general injustice and false
        judgment which she has practiced generally in all her works, but much
        more on account of the particular injustice and false judgment which she
        practices at the end, in judging her misery greater than My mercy. This
        is that sin which is neither pardoned here nor there, because the soul
        would not be pardoned, depreciating My mercy. Therefore is this last sin
        graver to Me than all the other sins that the soul has committed.
        Wherefore the despair of Judas displeased Me more, and was more grave to
        My Son than was his betrayal of Him. So that they are reproved of this
        false judgment, which is to have held their sin to be greater than My
        mercy, and, on that account, are they punished with the devils, and
        eternally tortured with them. And they are reproved of injustice because
        they grieve more over their condemnation than over My displeasure, and
        do not render to Me that which is Mine, and to themselves that which is
        theirs. For to Me, they ought to render love, and to themselves
        bitterness, with contrition of heart, and offer it to Me, for the
        offense they have done Me. And they do the contrary because they give to
        themselves love, pitying themselves, and grieving on account of the pain
        they expect for their sin; so you see that they are guilty of injustice
        and false judgment, and are punished for the one and the other together.
        Wherefore, they, having depreciated My mercy, I with justice send them,
        with their cruel servant, sensuality, and the cruel tyrant the Devil,
        whose servants they made themselves through their own sensuality, so
        that, together, they are punished and tormented, as together they have
        offended Me. Tormented, I say, by My ministering devils whom My judgment
        has appointed to torment those who have done evil." 
          
         Of the four principal torments of the damned, from which follow all
        the others; and particularly of the foulness of the Devil. 
          
         "My daughter, the tongue is not sufficient to narrate the pain
        of these poor souls. As there are three principal vices, namely:
        self-love, whence proceeds the second, that is love of reputation,
        whence proceeds the third, that is pride, with injustice and cruelty,
        and with other filthiness and iniquitous sins, that follow upon these.
        So I say to you, that in Hell, the souls have four principal torments,
        out of which proceed all the other torments. The first is, that they see
        themselves deprived of the vision of Me, which is such pain to them,
        that, were it possible, they would rather choose the fire, and the
        tortures and torments, and to see Me, than to be without the torments
        and not to see Me. 
         "This first pain revives in them, then, the second, the worm of
        Conscience, which gnaws unceasingly, seeing that the soul is deprived of
        Me, and of the conversation of the angels, through her sin, made worthy
        of the conversation and sight of the devils, which vision of the Devil
        is the third pain and redoubles to them their every toil. As the saints
        exult in the sight of Me, refreshing themselves with joyousness in the
        fruit of their toils borne for Me with such abundance of love, and
        displeasure of themselves, so does the sight of the Devil revive these
        wretched ones to torments, because in seeing him they know themselves
        more, that is to say, they know that, by their own sin, they have made
        themselves worthy of him. And so the worm of Conscience gnaws more and
        more, and the fire of this Conscience never ceases to burn. And the
        sight is more painful to them, because they see him in his own form,
        which is so horrible that the heart of man could not imagine it. And if
        you remember well, you know that I showed him to you in his own form for
        a little space of time, hardly a moment, and you chose (after you had
        returned to yourself) rather to walk on a road of fire, even until the
        Day of Judgment, than to see him again. With all this that you have
        seen, even you do not know well how horrible he is, because, by Divine
        justice, he appears more horrible to the soul that is deprived of Me,
        and more or less according to the gravity of her sin. The fourth torment
        that they have is the fire. This fire burns and does not consume, for
        the being of the soul cannot be consumed, because it is not a material
        thing that fire can consume. But I, by Divine justice, have permitted
        the fire to burn them with torments, so that it torments them, without
        consuming them, with the greatest pains in diverse ways according to the
        diversity of their sins, to some more, and to some less, according to
        the gravity of their fault. Out of these four torments issue all others,
        such as cold and heat and gnashing of the teeth and many others. Now
        because they did not amend themselves after the first reproof that they
        had of injustice and false judgment, neither in the second, which was
        that, in death, they would not hope in Me, nor grieve for the offense
        done to Me, but only for their own pain, have they thus so miserably
        received Eternal Punishment." 
          
         Of the third reproof which is made on the Day of Judgment. 
          
         "Now it remains to tell of the third reproof which is on the
        Last Day of Judgment. Already I have told you of two, and now, so that
        you may see how greatly man deceives himself, I will tell you of the
        third -- of the General Judgment, when the pain of the miserable soul is
        renewed and increased by the union that the soul will make with the
        body, with an intolerable reproof, which will generate in it confusion
        and shame. Know that, in the Last Day of Judgment, when will come the
        Word -- My Son, with My Divine Majesty to reprove the world with Divine
        Power, He will not come like a poor one, as when He was born, coming in
        the womb of the Virgin, and being born in a stable amongst the animals,
        and then dying between two thieves. Then I concealed My power in Him,
        letting Him suffer pain and torment like man, not that My divine nature
        was therefore separated from human nature, but I let Him suffer like man
        to satisfy for your guilt. He will not come thus in that last moment,
        but He will come, with power, to reprove in His Own Person, and will
        render to everyone his due, and there will be no one in that Day who
        will not tremble. To the miserable ones who are damned, His aspect will
        cause such torment and terror that the tongue cannot describe it. To the
        just it will cause the fear of reverence with great joy; not that His
        face changes, because He is unchangeable, being one thing with Me
        according to the divine nature, and, according to the human nature, His
        face was unchangeable, after it took the glory of the Resurrection. But,
        to the eye of the damned, it will appear such, on account of their
        terrible and darkened vision, that, as the sun which is so bright,
        appears all darkness to the infirm eye, but to the healthy eye light
        (and it is not the defect of the light that makes it appear other to the
        blind than to the illuminated one, but the defect of the eye which is
        infirm), so will the condemned ones see His countenance in darkness, in
        confusion, and in hatred, not through defect of My Divine Majesty, with
        which He will come to judge the world, but through their own
        defect." 
          
         How the damned cannot desire any good. 
          
         "And their hatred is so great that they cannot will or desire
        any good, but they continually blaspheme Me. And do you know why they
        cannot desire good? Because the life of man ended, free-will is bound.
        Wherefore they cannot merit, having lost, as they have, the time to do
        so. If they finish their life, dying in hatred with the guilt of mortal
        sin, their souls, by divine justice, remain forever bound with the bonds
        of hatred, and forever obstinate in that evil, in which, therefore,
        being gnawed by themselves, their pains always increase, especially the
        pains of those who have been the cause of damnation to others, as that
        rich man, who was damned, demonstrated to you when he begged the favor
        that Lazarus might go to his brothers, who were in the world, to tell
        them of his pains. This, certainly, he did not do out of love or
        compassion for his brothers, for he was deprived of love and could not
        desire good, either for My honor or their salvation, because, as I have
        already told you, the damned souls cannot do any good to their neighbor,
        and they blaspheme Me, because their life ended in hatred of Me and of
        virtue. But why then did he do it? He did it because he was the eldest,
        and had nourished them up in the same miseries in which he had lived, so
        that he was the cause of their damnation, and he saw pain increased to
        himself, on account of their damnation when they should arrive in
        torment together with him, to be gnawed forever by hatred, because in
        hatred they finished their lives." 
          
         Of the glory of the Blessed. 
          
         "Similarly, the just soul, for whom life finishes in the
        affection of charity and the bonds of love, cannot increase in virtue,
        time having come to naught, but she can always love with that affection
        with which she comes to Me, and that measure that is measured to her.
        She always desires Me, and loves Me, and her desire is not in vain --
        being hungry, she is satisfied, and being satisfied, she has hunger, but
        the tediousness of satiety and the pain of hunger are far from her. In
        love, the Blessed rejoice in My eternal vision, participating in that
        good that I have in Myself, everyone according to his measure, that is
        that, with that measure of love, with which they have come to Me, is it
        measured to them. Because they have lived in love of Me and of the
        neighbor, united together with the general love, and the particular,
        which, moreover, both proceed from the same love. And they rejoice and
        exult, participating in each other's good with the affection of love,
        besides the universal good that they enjoy altogether. And they rejoice
        and exult with the angels with whom they are placed, according to their
        diverse and various virtues in the world, being all bound in the bonds
        of love. And they have a special participation with those whom they
        closely loved with particular affection in the world, with which
        affection they grew in grace, increasing virtue, and the one was the
        occasion to the other of manifesting the glory and praise of My name, in
        themselves and in their neighbor; and, in the life everlasting, they
        have not lost their love, but have it still, participating closely, with
        more abundance, the one with the other, their love being added to the
        universal good, and I would not that you should think that they have
        this particular good, of which I have told you, for themselves alone,
        for it is not so, but it is shared by all the proved citizens, My
        beloved sons, and all the angels -- for, when the soul arrives at
        eternal life, all participate in the good of that soul, and the soul in
        their good. Not that her vessel or theirs can increase, nor that there
        be need to fill it, because it is full, but they have an exultation, a
        mirthfulness, a jubilee, a joyousness in themselves, which is refreshed
        by the knowledge that they have found in that soul. They see that, by My
        mercy, she is raised from the earth with the plenitude of grace, and
        therefore they exult in Me in the good of that soul, which good she has
        received through My goodness. 
         "And that soul rejoices in Me, and in the souls, and in the
        blessed spirits, seeing and tasting in them the beauty and the sweetness
        of My love. And their desires forever cry out to Me, for the salvation
        of the whole world. And because their life ended in the love of the
        neighbor, they have not left it behind, but, with it, they will pass
        through the Door, My only-begotten Son in the way that I will relate to
        you. So you see that in those bonds of love in which they finished their
        life, they go on and remain eternally. They are conformed so entirely to
        My will, that they cannot desire except what I desire, because their
        free-will is bound in the bond of love, in such a way that, time failing
        them, and, dying in a state of grace, they cannot sin any more. And
        their will is so united with Mine, that a father or a mother seeing
        their son, or a son seeing his father or his mother in Hell, do not
        trouble themselves, and even are contented to see them punished as My
        enemies. Wherefore in nothing do they disagree with Me, and their
        desires are all satisfied. The desire of the blessed is to see My honor
        in you wayfarers, who are pilgrims, forever running on towards the term
        of death. In their desire for My honor, they desire your salvation, and
        always pray to Me for you, which desire is fulfilled by Me, when you
        ignorant ones do not resist My mercy. They have a desire too, to regain
        the gifts of their body, but this desire does not afflict them, as they
        do not actually feel it, but they rejoice in tasting the desire, from
        the certainty they feel of having it fulfilled. Their desire does not
        afflict them, because, though they have it not yet fulfilled, no bliss
        is thereby lacking to them. Wherefore they feel not the pain of desire.
        And think not, that the bliss of the body after the resurrection gives
        more bliss to the soul, for, if this were so, it would follow that,
        until they had the body, they had imperfect bliss, which cannot be,
        because no perfection is lacking to them. So it is not the body that
        gives bliss to the soul, but the soul will give bliss to the body,
        because the soul will give of her abundance, and will re-clothe herself
        on the Last Day of Judgment, in the garments of her own flesh which she
        had quitted. For, as the soul is made immortal, stayed and established
        in Me, so the body in that union becomes immortal, and, having lost
        heaviness, is made fine and light. Wherefore, know that the glorified
        body can pass through a wall, and that neither water nor fire can injure
        it, not by virtue of itself, but by virtue of the soul, which virtue is
        of Me, given to her by grace, and by the ineffable love with which I
        created her in My image and likeness. The eye of your intellect is not
        sufficient to see, nor your ear to hear, nor your tongue to tell of the
        good of the Blessed. Oh, how much delight they have in seeing Me, who am
        every good! Oh, how much delight they will have in being with the
        glorified body, though, not having that delight from now to the general
        Judgment, they have not, on that account, pain, because no bliss is
        lacking to them, the soul being satisfied in herself, and, as I have
        told you, the body will participate in this bliss. 
         "I told you of the happiness which the glorified body would take
        in the glorified humanity of My only-begotten Son, which gives you
        assurance of your resurrection. There, they exult in His wounds, which
        have remained fresh, and the Scars in His Body are preserved, and
        continually cry for mercy for you, to Me, the Supreme and Eternal
        Father. And they are all conformed with Him, in joyousness and mirth,
        and you will all be conformed with Him, eye with eye, and hand with
        hand, and with the whole Body of the sweet Word My Son, and, dwelling in
        Me, you will dwell in Him, because He is one thing with Me. But their
        bodily eye, as I told you, will delight itself in the glorified humanity
        of the Word, My only-begotten Son. Why so? Because their life finished
        in the affection of My love, and therefore will this delight endure for
        them eternally. Not that they can work any good, but they rejoice and
        delight in that good which they have brought with them, that is, they
        cannot do any meritorious act, by which they could merit anything,
        because in this life alone can they merit and sin, according as they
        please, with free-will. 
         "These then do not await, with fear, the Divine judgment, but
        with joy, and the Face of My Son will not seem to them terrible, or full
        of hatred, because they finished their lives in love and affection for
        Me, and good-will towards their neighbor. So you see then, that the
        transformation is not in His Face, when He comes to judge with My Divine
        Majesty, but in the vision of those who will be judged by Him. To the
        damned He will appear with hatred and with justice. And to the saved
        with love and mercy." 
          
         How, after the General Judgment, the pain of the damned will
        increase. 
          
         "I have told you of the dignity of the Righteous, so that you
        may the better know the misery of the damned. For this is another of
        their pains, namely, the vision of the bliss of the righteous, which is
        to them an increase of pain, as, to the righteous, the damnation of the
        damned is an increase of exultation in My goodness. As light is seen
        better near darkness, and darkness near light, so the sight of the
        Blessed increases their pain. With pain they await the Last Day of
        Judgment, because they see, following it, an increase of pain to
        themselves. And so will it be, because when that terrible voice shall
        say to them, 'Arise, you dead, and come to judgment,' the soul will
        return with the body, in the just to be glorified, and in the damned to
        be tortured eternally. And the aspect of My Truth, and of all the
        blessed ones will reproach them greatly, and make them ashamed, and the
        worm of conscience will gnaw the pith of the tree, that is the soul, and
        also the bark outside, which is the body. They will be reproached by the
        Blood that was shed for them, and by the works of mercy, spiritual and
        temporal, which I did for them by means of My Son, and which they should
        have done for their neighbor, as is contained in the Holy Gospel. They
        will be reproved for their cruelty towards their neighbor, for their
        pride and self-love, for their filthiness and avarice; and when they see
        the mercy that they have received from Me, their reproof will seem to be
        intensified in harshness. At the time of death, the soul only is
        reproved, but, at the General Judgment, the soul is reproved together
        with the body, because the body has been the companion and instrument of
        the soul -- to do good and evil according as the free-will pleased.
        Every work, good or bad, is done by means of the body. And, therefore,
        justly, My daughter, glory and infinite good are rendered to My elect
        ones with their glorified body, rewarding them for the toils they bore
        for Me, together with the soul. And to the perverse ones will be
        rendered eternal pains by means of their body, because their body was
        the instrument of evil. Wherefore, being their body, restored, their
        pains will revive and increase at the aspect of My Son, their miserable
        sensuality with its filthiness, in the vision of their nature (that is,
        the humanity of Christ), united with the purity of My Deity, and of this
        mass of their Adam nature raised above all the choirs of Angels, and
        themselves, by their own fault, sunk into the depths of Hell. And they
        will see generosity and mercy shining in the blessed ones, who receive
        the fruit of the Blood of the Lamb, the pains that they have borne
        remaining as ornaments on their bodies, like the dye upon the cloth, not
        by virtue of the body but only out of the fullness of the soul,
        representing in the body the fruit of its labor, because it was the
        companion of the soul in the working of virtue. As in the mirror is
        represented the face of the man, so in the body is represented the fruit
        of bodily toils, in the way that I have told you. 
         "The pain and confusion of the darkened ones, on seeing so great
        a dignity (of which they are deprived), will increase, and their bodies
        will appear the sign of the wickedness they have committed, with pain
        and torture. And when they hear that terrible speech, 'Go, cursed ones,
        to the Eternal Fire,' the soul and the body will go to be with the Devil
        without any remedy or hope -- each one being wrapped up in diverse filth
        of earth, according to his evil works. The miser with the filth of
        avarice, wrapping himself up with the worldly substance which he loved
        disordinately, and the burning in the fire; the cruel one with cruelty;
        the foul man with foulness and miserable concupiscence; the unjust with
        his injustice; the envious with envy; and the hater of his neighbor with
        hatred. And inordinate self-love, whence were born all their ills, will
        be burnt with intolerable pain, as the head and principle of every evil,
        in company with pride. So that body and soul together will be punished
        in diverse ways. Thus miserably do they arrive at their end who go by
        the lower way, that is, by the river, not turning back to see their sins
        and My Mercy. And they arrive at the Gate of the Lie, because they
        follow the doctrine of the Devil, who is the Father of Lies; and this
        Devil is their Door, through which they go to Eternal Damnation, as has
        been said, as the elect and My sons, keeping by the way above, that is
        by the Bridge, follow the Way of Truth, and this Truth is the Door, and
        therefore said My Truth, 'No one can go to the Father but by Me.' He is
        the Door and the Way through which they pass to enter the Sea Pacific.
        It is the contrary for those who have kept the Way of the Lie, which
        leads them to the water of death. And it is to this that the Devil calls
        them, and they are as blind and mad, and do not perceive it, because
        they have lost the light of faith. The Devil says, as it were, to them:
        'Whosoever thirsts for the water of death, let him come and I will give
        it to him.'" 
          
         Of the use of temptations, and how every soul in her extremity sees
        her final place either of pain or of glory, before she is separated from
        the body. 
          
         "The Devil, dearest daughter, is the instrument of My Justice to
        torment the souls who have miserably offended Me. And I have set him in
        this life to tempt and molest My creatures, not for My creatures to be
        conquered, but that they may conquer, proving their virtue, and receive
        from Me the glory of victory. And no one should fear any battle or
        temptation of the Devil that may come to him, because I have made My
        creatures strong, and have given them strength of will, fortified in the
        Blood of my Son, which will, neither Devil nor creature can move,
        because it is yours, given by Me. You therefore, with free arbitration,
        can hold it or leave it, according as you please. It is an arm, which,
        if you place it in the hands of the Devil, straightway becomes a knife,
        with which he strikes you and slays you. But if man do not give this
        knife of his will into the hands of the Devil, that is, if he do not
        consent to his temptations and molestations, he will never be injured by
        the guilt of sin in any temptation, but will even be fortified by it,
        when the eye of his intellect is opened to see My love which allowed him
        to be tempted, so as to arrive at virtue, by being proved. For one does
        not arrive at virtue except through knowledge of self, and knowledge of
        Me, which knowledge is more perfectly acquired in the time of
        temptation, because then man knows himself to be nothing, being unable
        to lift off himself the pains and vexations which he would flee; and he
        knows Me in his will, which is fortified by My goodness, so that it does
        not yield to these thoughts. And he has seen that My love permits these
        temptations, for the devil is weak, and by himself can do nothing,
        unless I allow him. And I let him tempt, through love, and not through
        hatred, that you may conquer, and not that you may be conquered, and
        that you may come to a perfect knowledge of yourself, and of Me, and
        that virtue may be proved, for it is not proved except by its contrary.
        You see, then, that he is my Minister to torture the damned in Hell, and
        in this life, to exercise and prove virtue in the soul. Not that it is
        the intention of the Devil to prove virtue in you (for he has not love),
        but rather to deprive you of it, and this he cannot do, if you do not
        wish it. Now you see, then, how great is the foolishness of men in
        making themselves feeble, when I have made them strong, and in putting
        themselves into the hands of the Devil. Wherefore, know, that at the
        moment of death, they, having passed their life under the lordship of
        the Devil (not that they were forced to do so, for as I told you they
        cannot be forced, but they voluntarily put themselves into his hands),
        and, arriving at the extremity of their death under this perverse
        lordship, they await no other judgment than that of their own
        conscience, and desperately, despairingly, come to eternal damnation.
        Wherefore Hell, through their hate, surges up to them in the extremity
        of death, and before they get there, they take hold of it, by means of
        their lord the Devil. As the righteous, who have lived in charity and
        died in love, if they have lived perfectly in virtue, illuminated with
        the light of faith, with perfect hope in the Blood of the Lamb, when the
        extremity of death comes, see the good which I have prepared for them,
        and embrace it with the arms of love, holding fast with pressure of love
        to Me, the Supreme and Eternal Good. And so they taste eternal life
        before they have left the mortal body, that is, before the soul be
        separated from the body. Others who have passed their lives, and have
        arrived at the last extremity of death with an ordinary charity (not in
        that great perfection), embrace My mercy with the same light of faith
        and hope that had those perfect ones, but, in them, it is imperfect,
        for, because they were imperfect, they constrained My mercy, counting My
        mercy greater than their sins. The wicked sinners do the contrary, for,
        seeing, with desperation, their destination, they embrace it with
        hatred, as I told you. So that neither the one nor the other waits for
        judgment, but, in departing this life, they receive every one their
        place, as I have told you, and they taste it and possess it before they
        depart from the body, at the extremity of death -- the damned with
        hatred and with despair, and the perfect ones with love and the light of
        faith and with the hope of the Blood. And the imperfect arrive at the
        place of Purgatory, with mercy and the same faith." 
          
         How the Devil gets hold of souls, under pretense of some good: and,
        how those are deceived who keep by the river, and not by the aforesaid
        Bridge, for, wishing to fly pains, they fall into them; and of the
        vision of a tree, that this soul once had. 
          
         "I have told you that the Devil invites men to the water of
        death, that is, to that which he has, and, blinding them with the
        pleasures and conditions of the world, he catches them with the hook of
        pleasure, under the pretense of good, because in no other way could he
        catch them, for they would not allow themselves to be caught if they saw
        that no good or pleasure to themselves were to be obtained thereby. For
        the soul, from her nature, always relishes good, though it is true that
        the soul, blinded by self- love, does not know and discern what is true
        good, and of profit to the soul and to the body. And, therefore, the
        Devil, seeing them blinded by self-love, iniquitously places before them
        diverse and various delights, colored so as to have the appearance of
        some benefit or good; and he gives to everyone according to his
        condition and those principal vices to which he sees him to be most
        disposed -- of one kind to the secular, of another to the religious, and
        others to prelates and noblemen, according to their different
        conditions. I have told you this, because I now speak to you of those
        who drown themselves in the river, and who care for nothing but
        themselves, to love themselves to My injury, and I will relate to you
        their end. 
         "Now I want to show you how they deceive themselves, and how,
        wishing to flee troubles, they fall into them. For, because it seems to
        them that following Me, that is, walking by the way of the Bridge, the
        Word, My Son, is great toil, they draw back, fearing the thorn. This is
        because they are blinded and do not know or see the Truth, as, you know,
        I showed you in the beginning of your life, when you prayed Me to have
        mercy on the world, and draw it out of the darkness of mortal sin. You
        know that I then showed you Myself under the figure of a Tree, of which
        you saw neither the beginning nor the end, so that you did not see that
        the roots were united with the earth of your humanity. At the foot of
        the Tree, if you remember well, there was a certain thorn, from which
        thorn all those who love their own sensuality kept away, and ran to a
        mountain of Lolla, in which you figured to yourself all the delights of
        the world. That Lolla seemed to be of corn and was not, and, therefore,
        as you saw, many souls thereon died of hunger, and many, recognizing the
        deceits of the world, returned to the Tree and passed the thorn, which
        is the deliberation of the will. Which deliberation, before it is made,
        is a thorn which appears to man to stand in the way of following the
        Truth. And conscience always fights on one side, and sensuality on the
        other; but as soon as he, with hatred and displeasure of himself,
        manfully makes up his mind, saying, 'I wish to follow Christ crucified,'
        he breaks at once the thorn, and finds inestimable sweetness, as I
        showed you then, some finding more and some less, according to their
        disposition and desire. And you know that then I said to you, 'I am your
        God, unmoving and unchangeable,' and I do not draw away from any
        creature who wants to come to Me. I have shown them the Truth, making
        Myself visible to them, and I have shown them what it is to love
        anything without Me. But they, as if blinded by the fog of disordinate
        love, know neither Me nor themselves. You see how deceived they are,
        choosing rather to die of hunger than to pass a little thorn. And they
        cannot escape enduring pain, for no one can pass through this life
        without a cross, far less those who travel by the lower way. Not that My
        servants pass without pain, but their pain is alleviated. And because --
        by sin, as I said to you above -- the world germinates thorns and
        tribulations, and because this river flows with tempestuous waters, I
        gave you the Bridge, so that you might not be drowned. 
         "I have shown you how they are deceived by a disordinate fear,
        and how I am your God, immovable, who am not an Acceptor of persons but
        of holy desire. And this I have shown you under the figure of the Tree,
        as I told you." 
          
         How, the world having germinated thorns, who those are whom they do
        not harm; although no one passes this life without pain. 
          
         "Now I want to show you to whom the thorns and tribulations,
        that the world germinated through sin, do harm, and to whom they do not.
        And as, so far, I have shown you the damnation of sinners, together with
        My goodness, and have told you how they are deceived by their own
        sensuality, now I wish to tell you how it is only they themselves who
        are injured by the thorns. No one born passes this life without pain,
        bodily or mental. Bodily pain My servants bear, but their minds are
        free, that is, they do not feel the weariness of the pain; for their
        will is accorded with Mine, and it is the will that gives trouble to
        man. Pain of mind and of body have those, of whom I have narrated to
        you, who, in this life, taste the earnest money of hell, as My servants
        taste the earnest money of eternal life. Do you know what is the special
        good of the blessed ones? It is having their desire filled with what
        they desire; wherefore desiring Me, they have Me, and taste Me without
        any revolt, for they have left the burden of the body, which was a law
        that opposed the spirit, and came between it and the perfect knowledge
        of the Truth, preventing it from seeing Me face to face. But after the
        soul has left the weight of the body, her desire is full, for, desiring
        to see Me, she sees Me, in which vision is her bliss; and seeing she
        knows, and knowing she loves, and loving she tastes Me, Supreme and
        Eternal Good, and, in tasting Me, she is satisfied, and her desire is
        fulfilled, that is, the desire she had to see and know Me; wherefore
        desiring she has, and having she desires. And as I told you pain is far
        from the desire, and weariness from the satisfaction of it. So you see
        that My servants are blessed principally in seeing and in knowing Me, in
        which vision and knowledge their will is fulfilled, for they have that
        which they desired to have, and so are they satisfied. Wherefore I told
        you that the tasting of eternal life consisted especially in having that
        which the will desires, and thus being satisfied; but know that the will
        is satisfied in seeing and knowing Me, as I have told you. In this life
        then, they taste the earnest money of eternal life, tasting the above,
        with which I have told you they will be satisfied. 
         "But how have they the earnest money in this present life? I
        reply to you, they have it in seeing My goodness in themselves, and in
        the knowledge of My Truth, which knowledge, the intellect (which is the
        eye of the soul) illuminated in Me, possesses. This eye has the pupil of
        the most holy faith, which light of faith enables the soul to discern,
        to know, and to follow the way and the doctrine of My Truth -- the Word
        Incarnate; and without this pupil of faith she would not see, except as
        a man who has the form of the eye, but who has covered the pupil (which
        causes the eye to see) with a cloth. So the pupil of the intellect is
        faith, and if the soul has covered it with the cloth of infidelity,
        drawn over it by self-love, she does not see, but only has the form of
        the eye without the light, because she has hidden it. Thus you see, that
        in seeing they know, and in knowing they love, and in loving they deny
        and lose their self-will. Their own will lost, they clothe themselves in
        Mine, and I will nothing but your sanctification. At once they set to,
        turning their back to the way below, and begin to ascend by the Bridge,
        and pass over the thorns, which do not hurt them, their feet being shod
        with the affection of My love. For I told you that My servants suffered
        corporally but not mentally, because the sensitive will, which gives
        pain and afflicts the mind of the creature, is dead. Wherefore, the will
        not being there, neither is there any pain. They bear everything with
        reverence, deeming themselves favored in having tribulation for My sake,
        and they desire nothing but what I desire. If I allow the Devil to
        trouble them, permitting temptations to prove them in virtue, as I told
        you above, they resist with their will fortified in Me, humiliating
        themselves, and deeming themselves unworthy of peace and quiet of mind
        and deserving of pain, and so they proceed with cheerfulness and self-
        knowledge, without painful affliction. And if tribulations on man's
        account, or infirmity, or poverty, or change of worldly condition, or
        loss of children, or of other much loved creatures (all of which are
        thorns that the earth produced after sin) come upon them, they endure
        them all with the light of reason and holy faith, looking to Me, who am
        the Supreme Good, and who cannot desire other than good, for which I
        permit these tribulations through love, and not through hatred. And they
        that love Me recognize this, and, examining themselves, they see their
        sins, and understand by the light of faith, that good must be rewarded
        and evil punished. And they see that every little sin merits infinite
        pain, because it is against Me, who am Infinite Good, wherefore they
        deem themselves favored because I wish to punish them in this life, and
        in this finite time; they drive away sin with contrition of heart, and
        with perfect patience do they merit, and their labors are rewarded with
        infinite good. Hereafter they know that all labor in this life is small,
        on account of the shortness of time. Time is as the point of a needle
        and no more; and, when time has passed labor is ended, therefore you see
        that the labor is small. They endure with patience, and the thorns they
        pass through do not touch their heart, because their heart is drawn out
        of them and united to Me by the affection of love. It is a good truth
        then that these do taste eternal life, receiving the earnest money of it
        in this life, and that, though they walk on thorns, they are not
        pricked, because as I told you, they have known My Supreme Goodness, and
        sought for it where it was to be found, that is in the Word, My
        only-begotten son." 
          
         How this soul was in great bitterness, on account of the blindness of
        those who are drowned below in the river. 
          
         Then that soul, tormented by desire, considering her own
        imperfections and those of others, was saddened to hear of and to see
        the great blindness of creatures, notwithstanding the great goodness of
        God, in having placed nothing in this life, no matter in what condition,
        that could be an impediment to the salvation of creatures, but rather
        arranged for the exercising and proving of virtue in them. And,
        notwithstanding all this, she saw them, through self-love and
        disordinate affection, go under by the river and arrive at eternal
        damnation, and many who were in the river and had begun to come out,
        turn back again, scandalized at her, because they had heard of the sweet
        goodness of GOD, who had deigned to manifest Himself to her. And, for
        this, she was in bitterness, and fixing the eye of her intellect on the
        Eternal Father, she said: "Oh, Inestimable Love, great is the
        delusion of Your creatures. I would that, when it is pleasing to Your
        Goodness, You would more clearly explain to me the three steps figured
        in the Body of Your only Son, and what method should be used so as to
        come entirely out of the depths and to keep the way of Your Truth, and
        who are those who ascend the staircase." 
          
         How the three steps figured in the Bridge, that is, in the Son of
        GOD, signify the three powers of the soul. 
          
         Then the Divine Goodness, regarding with the eye of His mercy, the
        hunger and desire of that soul, said: "Oh, My most delightful
        daughter, I am not a Despiser, but the Fulfiller of holy desire, and
        therefore I will show and declare to you that which you ask Me. You ask
        Me to explain to you the figure of three steps, and to tell you what
        method they who want to come out of the river must use, to be able to
        ascend the Bridge. And, although above, in relating to you the delusion
        and blindness of men, tasting in this life the earnest-money of Hell,
        and, as martyrs of the Devil, receiving damnation, I showed you the
        methods they should use; nevertheless, now I will declare it to you more
        fully, satisfying your desire. You know that every evil is founded in
        self-love, and that self-love is a cloud that takes away the light of
        reason, which reason holds in itself the light of faith, and one is not
        lost without the other. The soul I created in My image and similitude,
        giving her memory, intellect, and will. The intellect is the most noble
        part of the soul, and is moved by the affection, and nourishes it, and
        the hand of love -- that is, the affection -- fills the memory with the
        remembrance of Me and of the benefits received, which it does with care
        and gratitude, and so one power spurs on another, and the soul is
        nourished in the life of grace. 
         "The soul cannot live without love, but always wants to love
        something, because she is made of love, and, by love, I created her. And
        therefore I told you that the affection moved the intellect, saying, as
        it were, 'I will love, because the food on which I feed is love.' Then
        the intellect, feeling itself awakened by the affection, says, as it
        were, 'If you will love, I will give you that which you can love.' And
        at once it arises, considering carefully the dignity of the soul, and
        the indignity into which she has fallen through sin. In the dignity of
        her being it tastes My inestimable goodness, and the increate charity
        with which I created her, and, in contemplating her misery, it discovers
        and tastes My mercy, and sees how, through mercy, I have lent her time
        and drawn her out of darkness. Then the affection nourishes itself in
        love, opening the mouth of holy desire, with which it eats hatred and
        displeasure of its own sensuality, united with true humility and perfect
        patience, which it drew from holy hatred. The virtues conceived, they
        give birth to themselves perfectly and imperfectly, according as the
        soul exercises perfection in herself, as I will tell you below. So, on
        the contrary, if the sensual affection wants to love sensual things, the
        eye of the intellect set before itself for its sole object transitory
        things, with self-love, displeasure of virtue, and love of vice, whence
        she draws pride and impatience, and the memory is filled with nothing
        but that which the affection presents to it. This love so dazzles the
        eye of the intellect that it can discern and see nothing but such
        glittering objects. It is the very brightness of the things that causes
        the intellect to perceive them and the affection to love them; for had
        worldly things no such brightness there would be no sin, for man, by his
        nature, cannot desire anything but good, and vice, appearing to him
        thus, under color of the soul's good, causes him to sin. But, because
        the eye, on account of its blindness, does not discern, and knows not
        the truth, it errs, seeking good and delights there where they are not. 
         "I have already told you that the delights of the world, without
        Me, are venomous thorns, and, that the vision of the intellect is
        deluded by them, and the affection of the will is deluded into loving
        them, and the memory into retaining remembrance of them. The unity of
        these powers of the soul is so great that I cannot be offended by one
        without all the others offending Me at the same time, because the one
        presents to the other, as I told you, good or evil, according to the
        pleasure of the free will. This free will is bound to the affection, and
        it moves as it pleases, either with the light of reason or without it.
        Your reason is attached to Me when your will does not, by disordinate
        love, cut it off from Me; you have also in you the law of perversity,
        that continually fights against the Spirit. You have, then, two parts in
        you -- sensuality and reason. Sensuality is appointed to be the servant,
        so that, with the instrument of the body, you may prove and exercise the
        virtues. The soul is free, liberated from sin by the Blood of My Son,
        and she cannot be dominated unless she consent with her will, which is
        controlled by her free choice, and when this free choice agrees with the
        will, it becomes one thing with it. And I tell you truly, that, when the
        soul undertakes to gather together, with the hand of free choice, her
        powers in My Name, then are assembled all the actions, both spiritual
        and temporal, that the creature can do, and free choice gets rid of
        sensuality and binds itself with reason. I, then, by grace, rest in the
        midst of them; and this is what My truth, the Word Incarnate, meant,
        when He said: 'When there are two or three or more gathered together in
        My name, there am I in the midst of them.' And this is the truth. I have
        already told you that no one could come to Me except by Him, and
        therefore I made of Him a Bridge with three steps. And those three steps
        figure, as I will narrate to you below, the three states of the
        soul." 
          
         How if the three aforesaid powers are not united, there cannot be
        perseverance, without which no man arrives at his end. 
          
         "I have explained to you the figure of the three steps, in
        general, as the three powers of the soul, and no one who wishes to pass
        by the Bridge and doctrine of My Truth can mount one without the other,
        and the soul cannot persevere except by the union of her three powers.
        Of which I told you above, when you asked Me, how the voyagers could
        come out of the river. There are two goals, and, for the attainment of
        either, perseverance is needful -- they are vice and virtue. If you
        desire to arrive at life, you must persevere in virtue, and if you would
        have eternal death, you must persevere in vice. Thus it is with
        perseverance that they who want life arrive at Me who am Life, and with
        perseverance that they who taste the water of death arrive at the
        Devil." 
          
         An exposition on Christ's words: "Whosoever thirsts, let him
        come to Me and drink." 
          
         "You were all invited, generally and in particular, by My Truth,
        when He cried in the Temple, saying: 'Whosoever thirsts, let him come to
        Me and drink, for I am the Fountain of the Water of Life.' He did not
        say 'Go to the Father and drink,' but He said 'Come to Me.' He spoke
        thus, because in Me, the Father, there can be no pain, but in My Son
        there can be pain. And you, while you are pilgrims and wayfarers in this
        mortal life, cannot be without pain, because the earth, through sin,
        brought forth thorns. And why did He say 'Let him come to Me and drink'?
        Because whoever follows His doctrine, whether in the most perfect way or
        by dwelling in the life of common charity, finds to drink, tasting the
        fruit of the Blood, through the union of the Divine nature with the
        human nature. And you, finding yourselves in Him, find yourselves also
        in Me, who am the Sea Pacific, because I am one thing with Him, and He
        with Me. So that you are invited to the Fountain of Living Water of
        Grace, and it is right for you, with perseverance, to keep by Him who is
        made for you a Bridge, not being turned back by any contrary wind that
        may arise, either of prosperity or adversity, and to persevere till you
        find Me, who am the Giver of the Water of Life, by means of this sweet
        and amorous Word, My only-begotten Son. And why did He say: 'I am the
        Fountain of Living Water'? Because He was the Fountain which contained
        Me, the Giver of the Living Water, by means of the union of the Divine
        with the human nature. Why did He say 'Come to Me and drink'? Because
        you cannot pass this mortal life without pain, and in Me, the Father,
        there can be no pain, but in Him there can be pain, and therefore of Him
        did I make for you a Bridge. No one can come to Me except by Him, as He
        told you in the words: 'No one can come to the Father except by Me.' 
         "Now you have seen to what way you should keep, and how, namely
        with perseverance, otherwise you shall not drink, for perseverance
        receives the crown of glory and victory in the life everlasting." 
          
         The general method by which every rational creature can come out of
        the sea of the world, and go by the aforesaid holy Bridge. 
          
         "I will now return to the three steps, which you must climb in
        order to issue from the river without drowning, and attain to the Living
        Water, to which you are invited, and to desire My Presence in the midst
        of you. For in this way, in which you should follow, I am in your midst,
        reposing, by grace, in your souls. In order to have desire to mount the
        steps, you must have thirst, because only those who thirst are invited:
        'Whosoever thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.' He who has no thirst
        will not persevere, for either fatigue causes him to stop, or pleasure,
        and he does not care to carry the vessel with which he may get the
        water, and neither does he care for the company, and alone he cannot go,
        and he turns back at the smallest prick of persecution, for he loves it
        not. He is afraid because he is alone; were he accompanied he would not
        fear, and had he ascended the three steps he would not have been alone,
        and would, therefore, have been secure. You must then have thirst and
        gather yourselves together, as it is said, 'two or three or more.' 
         "Why is it said 'two or three or more'? Because there are not
        two without three, nor three without two, neither three nor two without
        more. The number one is excluded, for, unless a man has a companion, I
        cannot be in the midst; this is no indifferent trifle, for he who is
        wrapped up in self-love is solitary. 
         "Why is he solitary? Because he is separated from My grace and
        the love of his neighbor, and being, by sin, deprived of Me, he turns to
        that which is naught, because I am He that is. So that he who is
        solitary, that is, who is alone in self-love, is not mentioned by My
        Truth and is not acceptable to Me. He says then: 'If there be two or
        three or more gathered together in My name, I will be in the midst of
        them.' I said to you that two were not without three, nor three without
        two, and so it is. You know that the commandments of the Law are
        completely contained in two, and if these two are not observed the Law
        is not observed. The two commandments are to love Me above everything,
        and your neighbor as yourself, which two are the beginning, the middle
        and the end of the Law. These two cannot be gathered together in My
        Name, without three, that is without the congregation of the powers of
        the soul, the memory, the intellect, and the will; the memory to retain
        the remembrance of My benefits and My goodness, the intellect to gaze
        into the ineffable love, which I have shown you by means of My
        only-begotten Son, whom I have placed as the object of the vision of
        your intellect, so that, in Him, you behold the fire of My charity, and
        the will to love and desire Me, who am your End. When these virtues and
        powers of the soul are congregated together in My Name, I am in the
        midst of them by grace, and a man, who is full of My love and that of
        his neighbor, suddenly finds himself the companion of many and royal
        virtues. Then the appetite of the soul is disposed to thirst. Thirst, I
        say, for virtue, and the honor of My Name and salvation of souls, and
        his every other thirst is spent and dead, and he then proceeds securely
        without any servile fear, having ascended the first step of the
        affection, for the affection, stripped of self-love, mounts above itself
        and above transitory things, or, if he will still hold them, he does so
        according to My will -- that is, with a holy and true fear, and love of
        virtue. He then finds that he has attained to the second step -- that
        is, to the light of the intellect, which is, through Christ crucified,
        mirrored in cordial love of Me, for through Him have I shown My love to
        man. He finds peace and quiet, because the memory is filled with My
        love. You know that an empty thing, when touched, resounds, but not so
        when it is full. So memory, being filled with the light of the
        intellect, and the affection with love, on being moved by the
        tribulations or delights of the world, will not resound with disordinate
        merriment or with impatience, because they are full of Me, who am every
        good. 
         "Having climbed the three steps, he finds that the three powers
        of the soul have been gathered together by his reason in My Name. And
        his soul, having gathered together the two commandments, that is love of
        Me and of the neighbor, finds herself accompanied by Me, who am her
        strength and security, and walks safely because I am in the midst of
        her. Wherefore then he follows on with anxious desire, thirsting after
        the way of Truth, in which way he finds the Fountain of the Water of
        Life, through his thirst for My honor and his own salvation and that of
        his neighbor, without which thirst he would not be able to arrive at the
        Fountain. He walks on, carrying the vessel of the heart, emptied of
        every affection and disordinate love of the world, but filled
        immediately it is emptied with other things, for nothing can remain
        empty, and, being without disordinate love for transitory things, it is
        filled with love of celestial things, and sweet Divine love, with which
        he arrives at the Fountain of the Water of Life, and passes through the
        Door of Christ crucified, and tastes the Water of Life, finding himself
        in Me, the Sea Pacific." 
          
         How this devoted soul looking in the Divine mirror saw the creatures
        going in diverse ways. 
          
         Then that soul, tormented with intense desire, gazing into the sweet
        Divine mirror, saw creatures setting out to attain their end in diverse
        ways and with diverse considerations. She saw that many began to mount,
        feeling themselves pricked by servile fear, that is, fearing their own
        personal pain, and she saw others, practicing this first state, arriving
        at the second state, but few she saw who arrived at the greatest
        perfection. 
          
         How servile fear is not sufficient, without the love of virtue, to
        give eternal life; and how the law of fear and that of love are united. 
          
         Then the goodness of God, wishing to satisfy the desire of that soul,
        said, "Do you see those? They have arisen with servile fear from
        the vomit of mortal sin, but, if they do not arise with love of virtue,
        servile fear alone is not sufficient to give eternal life. But love with
        holy fear is sufficient, because the law is founded in love and holy
        fear. The old law was the law of fear, that was given by Me to Moses, by
        which law they who committed sin suffered the penalty of it. The new law
        is the law of love, given by the Word of My only-begotten Son, and is
        founded in love alone. The new law does not break the old law, but
        rather fulfills it, as said My Truth, 'I come not to destroy the law,
        but to fulfill it.' And He united the law of fear with that of love.
        Through love was taken away the imperfection of the fear of the penalty,
        and the perfection of holy fear remained, that is, the fear of
        offending, not on account of one's own damnation, but of offending Me,
        who am Supreme Good. So that the imperfect law was made perfect with the
        law of love. Wherefore, after the car of the fire of My only-begotten
        Son came and brought the fire of My charity into your humanity with
        abundance of mercy, the penalty of the sins committed by humanity was
        taken away, that is, he who offended was no longer punished suddenly, as
        was of old given and ordained in the law of Moses. 
         "There is, therefore, no need for servile fear; and this does
        not mean that sin is not punished, but that the punishment is reserved,
        unless, that is to say, the person punish himself in this life with
        perfect contrition. For, in the other life, the soul is separated from
        the body, wherefore while man lives is his time for mercy, but when he
        is dead comes the time of justice. He ought, then, to arise from servile
        fear, and arrive at love and holy fear of Me, otherwise there is no
        remedy against his falling back again into the river, and reaching the
        waters of tribulation, and seeking the thorns of consolation, for all
        consolations are thorns that pierce the soul who loves them
        disordinately." 
          
         How, by exercising oneself in servile fear, which is the state of
        imperfection, by which is meant the first step of the holy Bridge, one
        arrives at the second step, which is the state of perfection. 
          
         "I told you that no one could go by the Bridge or come out of
        the river without climbing the three steps, which is the truth. There
        are some who climb imperfectly, and some perfectly, and some climb with
        the greatest perfection. The first are those who are moved by servile
        fear, and have climbed so far being imperfectly gathered together; that
        is to say, the soul, having seen the punishment which follows her sin,
        climbs; and gathers together her memory to recollect her vice, her
        intellect to see the punishment which she expects to receive for her
        fault, and her will to move her to hate that fault. And let us consider
        this to be the first step and the first gathering together of the powers
        of the soul, which should be exercised by the light of the intellect
        with the pupil of the eye of holy faith, which looks, not only at the
        punishment of sin, but at the fruit of virtue, and the love which I bear
        to the soul, so that she may climb with love and affection, and stripped
        of servile fear. And doing so, such souls will become faithful and not
        unfaithful servants, serving Me through love and not through fear, and
        if, with hatred of sin, they employ their minds to dig out the root of
        their self-love with prudence, constancy, and perseverance they will
        succeed in doing so. But there are many who begin their course climbing
        so slowly, and render their debt to Me by such small degrees, and with
        such negligence and ignorance, that they suddenly faint, and every
        little breeze catches their sails, and turns their prow backwards.
        Wherefore, because they imperfectly climb to the first Step of the
        Bridge of Christ crucified, they do not arrive at the second step of His
        Heart." 
          
         Of the imperfection of those who love GOD for their own profit,
        delight, and consolation. 
          
         "Some there are who have become faithful servants, serving Me
        with fidelity without servile fear of punishment, but rather with love.
        This very love, however, if they serve Me with a view to their own
        profit, or the delight and pleasure which they find in Me, is imperfect.
        Do you know what proves the imperfection of this love? The withdrawal of
        the consolations which they found in Me, and the insufficiency and short
        duration of their love for their neighbor, which grows weak by degrees,
        and oftentimes disappears. Towards Me their love grows weak when, on
        occasion, in order to exercise them in virtue and raise them above their
        imperfection, I withdraw from their minds My consolation and allow them
        to fall into battles and perplexities. This I do so that, coming to
        perfect self-knowledge, they may know that of themselves they are
        nothing and have no grace, and accordingly in time of battle fly to Me,
        as their Benefactor, seeking Me alone, with true humility, for which
        purpose I treat them thus, without drawing from them consolation indeed,
        but not grace. At such a time these weak ones, of whom I speak, relax
        their energy, impatiently turning backwards, and sometimes abandon,
        under color of virtue, many of their exercises, saying to themselves,
        This labor does not profit me. All this they do, because they feel
        themselves deprived of mental consolation. Such a soul acts imperfectly,
        for she has not yet unwound the bandage of spiritual self-love, for, had
        she unwound it she would see that, in truth, everything proceeds from
        Me, that no leaf of a tree falls to the ground without My providence,
        and that what I give and promise to My creatures, I give and promise to
        them for their sanctification, which is the good and the end for which I
        created them. My creatures should see and know that I wish nothing but
        their good, through the Blood of My only-begotten Son, in which they are
        washed from their iniquities. By this Blood they are enabled to know My
        Truth, how, in order to give them eternal life, I created them in My
        image and likeness and re-created them to grace with the Blood of My
        Son, making them sons of adoption. But, since they are imperfect, they
        make use of Me only for their own profit, relaxing their love for their
        neighbor. Thus, those in the first state come to naught through the fear
        of enduring pain, and those in the second, because they slacken their
        pace, ceasing to render service to their neighbor, and withdrawing their
        charity if they see their own profit or consolation withdrawn from them:
        this happens because their love was originally impure, for they gave to
        their neighbor the same imperfect love which they gave to Me, that is to
        say, a love based only on desire of their own advantage. If, through a
        desire for perfection, they do not recognize this imperfection of
        theirs, it is impossible that they should not turn back. For those who
        desire Eternal Life, a pure love, prescinding from themselves, is
        necessary, for it is not enough for eternal life to fly sin from fear of
        punishment, or to embrace virtue from the motive of one's own advantage.
        Sin should be abandoned because it is displeasing to Me, and virtue
        should be loved for My sake. It is true that, generally speaking, every
        person is first called in this way, but this is because the soul herself
        is at first imperfect, from which imperfection she must advance to
        perfection, either while she lives, by a generous love to Me with a pure
        and virtuous heart that takes no thought for herself, or, at least, in
        the moment of death, recognizing her own imperfection, with the purpose,
        had she but time, of serving Me, irrespectively of herself. It was with
        this imperfect love that S. Peter loved the sweet and good Jesus, My
        only-begotten Son, enjoying most pleasantly His sweet conversation, but,
        when the time of trouble came, he failed, and so disgraceful was his
        fall, that, not only could he not bear any pain himself, but his terror
        of the very approach of pain caused him to fall, and deny the Lord, with
        the words, 'I have never known Him.' The soul who has climbed this step
        with servile fear and mercenary love alone, falls into many troubles.
        Such souls should arise and become sons, and serve Me, irrespective of
        themselves, for I, who am the Rewarder of every labor, render to each
        man according to his state and his labor; wherefore, if these souls do
        not abandon the exercise of holy prayer and their other good works, but
        go on, with perseverance, to increase their virtues, they will arrive at
        the state of filial love, because I respond to them with the same love,
        with which they love Me, so that, if they love Me, as a servant does his
        master, I pay them their wages according to their deserts, but I do not
        reveal Myself to them, because secrets are revealed to a friend, who has
        become one thing with his friend, and not to a servant. Yet it is true,
        that a servant may so advance by the virtuous love, which he bears to
        his master, as to become a very dear friend, and so do some of these of
        whom I have spoken, but while they remain in the state of mercenary
        love, I do not manifest Myself to them. If they, through displeasure at
        their imperfection, and love of virtue, dig up, with hatred, the root of
        spiritual self-love, and mount to the throne of conscience, reasoning
        with themselves, so as to quell the motions of servile fear in their
        heart, and to correct mercenary love by the light of the holy faith,
        they will be so pleasing to Me, that they will attain to the love of the
        friend. And I will manifest Myself to them, as My Truth said in these
        words: 'He who loves Me shall be one thing with Me and I with him, and I
        will manifest Myself to him and we will dwell together.' This is the
        state of two dear friends, for though they are two in body, yet they are
        one in soul through the affection of love, because love transforms the
        lover into the object loved, and where two friends have one soul, there
        can be no secret between them, wherefore My Truth said: 'I will come and
        we will dwell together,' and this is the truth." 
          
         Of the way in which GOD manifests Himself to the soul who loves Him. 
          
         "Do you know how I manifest Myself to the soul who loves Me in
        truth, and follows the doctrine of My sweet and amorous Word? In many is
        My virtue manifested in the soul in proportion to her desire, but I make
        three special manifestations. The first manifestation of My virtue, that
        is to say, of My love and charity in the soul, is made through the Word
        of My Son, and shown in the Blood, which He spilled with such fire of
        love. Now this charity is manifested in two ways; first, in general, to
        ordinary people, that is to those who live in the ordinary grace of God.
        It is manifested to them by the many and diverse benefits which they
        receive from Me. The second mode of manifestation, which is developed
        from the first, is peculiar to those who have become My friends in the
        way mentioned above, and is known through a sentiment of the soul, by
        which they taste, know, prove, and feel it. This second manifestation,
        however, is in men themselves; they manifesting Me, through the
        affection of their love. For though I am no Acceptor of creatures, I am
        an Acceptor of holy desires, and Myself in the soul in that precise
        degree of perfection which she seeks in Me. Sometimes I manifest Myself
        (and this is also a part of the second manifestation) by endowing men
        with the spirit of prophecy, showing them the things of the future. This
        I do in many and diverse ways, according as I see need in the soul
        herself and in other creatures. At other times the third manifestation
        takes place. I then form in the mind the presence of the Truth, My only-
        begotten Son, in many ways, according to the will and the desire of the
        soul. Sometimes she seeks Me in prayer, wishing to know My power, and I
        satisfy her by causing her to taste and see My virtue. Sometimes she
        seeks Me in the wisdom of My Son, and I satisfy her by placing His
        wisdom before the eye of her intellect, sometimes in the clemency of the
        Holy Spirit and then My Goodness causes her to taste the fire of Divine
        charity, and to conceive the true and royal virtues, which are founded
        on the pure love of her neighbor." 
          
         Why Christ did not say "I will manifest My Father," but
        "I will manifest myself." 
          
         "You see now how truly My Word spoke, when He said: 'He who
        loves Me shall be one thing with Me.' Because, by following His doctrine
        with the affection of love, you are united with Him, and, being united
        with Him, you are united with Me, because We are one thing together. And
        so it is that I manifest Myself to you, because We are one and the same
        thing together. Wherefore if My Truth said, 'I will manifest Myself to
        you,' He said the truth, because, in manifesting Himself, He manifested
        Me, and, in manifesting Me, He manifested Himself. But why did He not
        say, 'I will manifest My Father to you'? For three reasons in
        particular. First, because He wished to show that He and I are not
        separate from each other, on which account He also made the following
        reply to S. Philip, when he said to Him, 'Show us the Father, and it is
        enough for us.' My Word said, 'Who sees Me sees the Father, and who sees
        the Father sees Me.' This He said because He was one thing with Me, and
        that which He had, He had from Me, I having nothing from Him; wherefore,
        again, He said to Judas, 'My doctrine is not Mine, but My Father's who
        sent Me,' because My Son proceeds from Me, not I from Him, though I with
        Him and He with Me are but one thing. For this reason He did not say 'I
        will manifest the Father,' but 'I will manifest Myself,' being one thing
        with the Father. The second reason was because, in manifesting Himself
        to you, He did not present to you anything He had not received from Me,
        the Father. These words, then, mean, the Father has manifested Himself
        to Me, because I am one thing with Him, and I will manifest to you, by
        means of Myself, Me and Him. The third reason was, because I, being
        invisible, could not be seen by you, until you should be separated from
        your bodies. Then, indeed, will you see Me, your GOD, and My Son, the
        Word, face to face. From now until after the general Resurrection, when
        your humanity will be conformed with the humanity of the Eternal Word,
        according to what I told you in the treatise of the Resurrection, you
        can see Me, with the eye of the intellect alone, for, as I am, you
        cannot see Me now. Wherefore I veiled the Divine nature with your
        humanity, so that you might see Me through that medium. I, the
        Invisible, made Myself, as it were, visible by sending you the Word, My
        Son, veiled in the flesh of your humanity. He manifested Me to you.
        Therefore it was that He did not say 'I will manifest the Father to
        you,' but rather, 'I will manifest Myself to you,' as if He should say,
        'According as My Father manifests himself to Me, will I manifest myself
        to you, for in this manifestation of Himself, He manifests Me.' Now
        therefore you understand why He did not say 'I will manifest the Father
        to you.' Both, because such a vision is impossible for you, while yet in
        the mortal body, and because He is one thing with Me." 
          
         How the soul, after having mounted the first step of the Bridge,
        should proceed to mount the second. 
          
         "You have now seen how excellent is the state of him who has
        attained to the love of a friend; climbing with the foot of affection,
        he has reached the secret of the Heart, which is the second of the three
        steps figured in the Body of My Son. I have told you what was meant by
        the three powers of the soul, and now I will show you how they signify
        the three states, through which the soul passes. Before treating of the
        third state, I wish to show you how a man becomes a friend and how, from
        a friend, he grows into a son, attaining to filial love, and how a man
        may know if he has become a friend. And first of how a man arrives at
        being a friend. In the beginning, a man serves Me imperfectly through
        servile fear, but, by exercise and perseverance, he arrives at the love
        of delight, finding his own delight and profit in Me. This is a
        necessary stage, by which he must pass, who would attain to perfect
        love, to the love that is of friend and son. I call filial love perfect,
        because thereby, a man receives his inheritance from Me, the Eternal
        Father, and because a son's love includes that of a friend, which is why
        I told you that a friend grows into a son. What means does he take to
        arrive thereat? I will tell you. Every perfection and every virtue
        proceeds from charity, and charity is nourished by humility, which
        results from the knowledge and holy hatred of self, that is, sensuality.
        To arrive thereat, a man must persevere, and remain in the cellar of
        self-knowledge in which he will learn My mercy, in the Blood of My
        only-begotten Son, drawing to Himself, with this love, My divine
        charity, exercising himself in the extirpation of his perverse
        self-will, both spiritual and temporal, hiding himself in his own house,
        as did Peter, who, after the sin of denying My Son, began to weep. Yet
        his lamentations were imperfect and remained so, until after the forty
        days, that is until after the Ascension. But when My Truth returned to
        Me, in His humanity, Peter and the others concealed themselves in the
        house, awaiting the coming of the Holy Spirit, which My Truth had
        promised them. They remained barred in from fear, because the soul
        always fears until she arrives at true love. But when they had
        persevered in fasting and in humble and continual prayer, until they had
        received the abundance of the Holy Spirit, they lost their fear, and
        followed and preached Christ crucified. So also the soul, who wishes to
        arrive at this perfection, after she has risen from the guilt of mortal
        sin, recognizing it for what it is, begins to weep from fear of the
        penalty, whence she rises to the consideration of My mercy, in which
        contemplation, she finds her own pleasure and profit. This is an
        imperfect state, and I, in order to develop perfection in the soul,
        after the forty days, that is after these two states, withdraw Myself
        from time to time, not in grace but in feeling. My Truth showed you this
        when He said to the disciples 'I will go and will return to you.' 
         "Everything that He said was said primarily, and in particular,
        to the disciples, but referred in general to the whole present and
        future, to those, that is to say, who should come after. He said 'I will
        go and will return to you;' and so it was, for, when the Holy Spirit
        returned upon the disciples, He also returned, as I told you above, for
        the Holy Spirit did not return alone, but came with My power, and the
        wisdom of the Son, who is one thing with Me, and with His own clemency,
        which proceeds from Me the Father, and from the Son. Now, as I told you,
        in order to raise the soul from imperfection, I withdraw Myself from her
        sentiment, depriving her of former consolations. When she was in the
        guilt of mortal sin, she had separated herself from Me, and I deprived
        her of grace through her own guilt, because that guilt had barred the
        door of her desires. Wherefore the sun of grace did not shine, not
        through its own defect, but through the defect of the creature, who bars
        the door of desire. When she knows herself and her darkness, she opens
        the window and vomits her filth, by holy confession. Then I, having
        returned to the soul by grace, withdraw Myself from her by sentiment,
        which I do in order to humiliate her, and cause her to seek Me in truth,
        and to prove her in the light of faith, so that she come to prudence.
        Then, if she love Me without thought of self, and with lively faith and
        with hatred of her own sensuality, she rejoices in the time of trouble,
        deeming herself unworthy of peace and quietness of mind. Now comes the
        second of the three things of which I told you, that is to say: how the
        soul arrives at perfection, and what she does when she is perfect. This
        is what she does. Though she perceives that I have withdrawn Myself, she
        does not, on that account, look back, but perseveres with humility in
        her exercises, remaining barred in the house of self-knowledge, and,
        continuing to dwell therein, awaits, with lively faith, the coming of
        the Holy Spirit, that is of Me, who am the fire of charity. How does she
        await me? Not in idleness, but in watching and continued prayer, and not
        only with physical, but also with intellectual watching, that is, with
        the eye of her mind alert, and, watching with the light of faith, she
        extirpates, with hatred, the wandering thoughts of her heart, looking
        for the affection of My charity, and knowing that I desire nothing but
        her sanctification, which is certified to her in the Blood of My Son. As
        long as her eye thus watches, illumined by the knowledge of Me and of
        herself, she continues to pray with the prayer of holy desire, which is
        a continued prayer, and also with actual prayer, which she practices at
        the appointed times, according to the orders of Holy Church. This is
        what the soul does in order to rise from imperfection and arrive at
        perfection, and it is to this end, namely that she may arrive at
        perfection, that I withdraw from her, not by grace but by sentiment.
        Once more do I leave her, so that she may see and know her defects, so
        that, feeling herself deprived of consolation and afflicted by pain, she
        may recognize her own weakness, and learn how incapable she is of
        stability or perseverance, thus cutting down to the very root of
        spiritual self-love, for this should be the end and purpose of all her
        self-knowledge, to rise above herself, mounting the throne of
        conscience, and not permitting the sentiment of imperfect love to turn
        again in its death-struggle, but, with correction and reproof, digging
        up the root of self-love, with the knife of self- hatred and the love of
        virtue." 
          
         How an imperfect lover of GOD loves his neighbor also imperfectly,
        and of the signs of this imperfect love. 
          
         "And I would have you know that just as every imperfection and
        perfection is acquired from Me, so is it manifested by means of the
        neighbor. And simple souls, who often love creatures with spiritual
        love, know this well, for, if they have received My love sincerely
        without any self-regarding considerations, they satisfy the thirst of
        their love for their neighbor equally sincerely. If a man carry away the
        vessel which he has filled at the fountain and then drink of it, the
        vessel becomes empty, but if he keep his vessel standing in the
        fountain, while he drinks, it always remains full. So the love of the
        neighbor, whether spiritual or temporal, should be drunk in Me, without
        any self-regarding considerations. I require that you should love Me
        with the same love with which I love you. This indeed you cannot do,
        because I loved you without being loved. All the love which you have for
        Me you owe to Me, so that it is not of grace that you love Me, but
        because you ought to do so. While I love you of grace, and not because I
        owe you My love. Therefore to Me, in person, you cannot repay the love
        which I require of you, and I have placed you in the midst of your
        fellows, that you may do to them that which you cannot do to Me, that is
        to say, that you may love your neighbor of free grace, without expecting
        any return from him, and what you do to him, I count as done to Me,
        which My Truth showed forth when He said to Paul, My persecutor --
        'Saul, Saul, why persecute you Me?' This He said, judging that Paul
        persecuted Him in His faithful. This love must be sincere, because it is
        with the same love with which you love Me, that you must love your
        neighbor. Do you know how the imperfection of spiritual love for the
        creature is shown? It is shown when the lover feels pain if it appear to
        him that the object of his love does not satisfy or return his love, or
        when he sees the beloved one's conversation turned aside from him, or
        himself deprived of consolation, or another loved more than he. In these
        and in many other ways can it be seen that his neighborly love is still
        imperfect, and that, though his love was originally drawn from Me, the
        Fountain of all love, he took the vessel out of the water, in order to
        drink from it. It is because his love for Me is still imperfect, that
        his neighborly love is so weak, and because the root of self-love has
        not been properly dug out. Wherefore I often permit such a love to
        exist, so that the soul may in this way come to the knowledge of her own
        imperfection, and for the same reason do I withdraw myself from the soul
        by sentiment, that she may be thus led to enclose herself in the house
        of self-knowledge, where is acquired every perfection. After which I
        return into her with more light and with more knowledge of My Truth, in
        proportion to the degree in which she refers to grace the power of
        slaying her own will. And she never ceases to cultivate the vine of her
        soul, and to root out the thorns of evil thoughts, replacing them with
        the stones of virtues, cemented together in the Blood of Christ
        crucified, which she has found on her journey across the Bridge of
        Christ, My only- begotten Son. For I told you, if you remember, that
        upon the Bridge, that is, upon the doctrine of My Truth, were built up
        the stones, based upon the virtue of His Blood, for it is in virtue of
        this Blood that the virtues give life." 
         
         A TREATISE OF PRAYER 
         
         Of the means which the soul takes to arrive at pure and generous
        love; and here begins the Treatise of Prayer. 
          
         "When the soul has passed through the doctrine of Christ
        crucified, with true love of virtue and hatred of vice, and has arrived
        at the house of self-knowledge and entered therein, she remains, with
        her door barred, in watching and constant prayer, separated entirely
        from the consolations of the world. Why does she thus shut herself in?
        She does so from fear, knowing her own imperfections, and also from the
        desire, which she has, of arriving at pure and generous love. And
        because she sees and knows well that in no other way can she arrive
        thereat, she waits, with a lively faith for My arrival, through increase
        of grace in her. How is a lively faith to be recognized? By perseverance
        in virtue, and by the fact that the soul never turns back for anything,
        whatever it be, nor rises from holy prayer, for any reason except (note
        well) for obedience or charity's sake. For no other reason ought she to
        leave off prayer, for, during the time ordained for prayer, the Devil is
        wont to arrive in the soul, causing much more conflict and trouble than
        when the soul is not occupied in prayer. This he does in order that holy
        prayer may become tedious to the soul, tempting her often with these
        words: 'This prayer avails you nothing, for you need attend to nothing
        except your vocal prayers.' He acts thus in order that, becoming wearied
        and confused in mind, she may abandon the exercise of prayer, which is a
        weapon with which the soul can defend herself from every adversary, if
        grasped with the hand of love, by the arm of free choice in the light of
        the Holy Faith." 
          
         Here, touching something concerning the Sacrament of the Body of
        Christ, the complete doctrine is given; and how the soul proceeds from
        vocal to mental prayer, and a vision is related which this devout soul
        once received. 
          
         "Know, dearest daughter, how, by humble, continual, and faithful
        prayer, the soul acquires, with time and perseverance, every virtue.
        Wherefore should she persevere and never abandon prayer, either through
        the illusion of the Devil or her own fragility, that is to say, either
        on account of any thought or movement coming from her own body, or of
        the words of any creature. The Devil often places himself upon the
        tongues of creatures, causing them to chatter nonsensically, with the
        purpose of preventing the prayer of the soul. All of this she should
        pass by, by means of the virtue of perseverance. Oh, how sweet and
        pleasant to that soul and to Me is holy prayer, made in the house of
        knowledge of self and of Me, opening the eye of the intellect to the
        light of faith, and the affections to the abundance of My charity, which
        was made visible to you, through My visible only- begotten Son, who
        showed it to you with His blood! Which Blood inebriates the soul and
        clothes her with the fire of divine charity, giving her the food of the
        Sacrament [which is placed in the tavern of the mystical body of the
        Holy Church] that is to say, the food of the Body and Blood of My Son,
        wholly God and wholly man, administered to you by the hand of My vicar,
        who holds the key of the Blood. This is that tavern, which I mentioned
        to you, standing on the Bridge, to provide food and comfort for the
        travelers and the pilgrims, who pass by the way of the doctrine of My
        Truth, lest they should faint through weakness. This food strengthens
        little or much, according to the desire of the recipient, whether he
        receives sacramentally or virtually. He receives sacramentally when he
        actually communicates with the Blessed Sacrament. He receives virtually
        when he communicates, both by desire of communion, and by contemplation
        of the Blood of Christ crucified, communicating, as it were,
        sacramentally, with the affection of love, which is to be tasted in the
        Blood which, as the soul sees, was shed through love. On seeing this the
        soul becomes inebriated, and blazes with holy desire and satisfies
        herself, becoming full of love for Me and for her neighbor. Where can
        this be acquired? In the house of self-knowledge with holy prayer, where
        imperfections are lost, even as Peter and the disciples, while they
        remained in watching and prayer, lost their imperfection and acquired
        perfection. By what means is this acquired? By perseverance seasoned
        with the most holy faith. "But do not think that the soul receives
        such ardor and nourishment from prayer, if she pray only vocally, as do
        many souls whose prayers are rather words than love. Such as these give
        heed to nothing except to completing Psalms and saying many
        paternosters. And when they have once completed their appointed tale,
        they do not appear to think of anything further, but seem to place
        devout attention and love in merely vocal recitation, which the soul is
        not required to do, for, in doing only this, she bears but little fruit,
        which pleases Me but little. But if you ask Me, whether the soul should
        abandon vocal prayer, since it does not seem to all that they are called
        to mental prayer, I should reply 'No.' The soul should advance by
        degrees, and I know well that, just as the soul is at first imperfect
        and afterwards perfect, so also is it with her prayer. She should
        nevertheless continue in vocal prayer, while she is yet imperfect, so as
        not to fall into idleness. But she should not say her vocal prayers
        without joining them to mental prayer, that is to say, that while she is
        reciting, she should endeavor to elevate her mind in My love, with the
        consideration of her own defects and of the Blood of My only- begotten
        Son, wherein she finds the breadth of My charity and the remission of
        her sins. And this she should do, so that self- knowledge and the
        consideration of her own defects should make her recognize My goodness
        in herself and continue her exercises with true humility. I do not wish
        defects to be considered in particular, but in general, so that the mind
        may not be contaminated by the remembrance of particular and hideous
        sins. But, as I said, I do not wish the soul to consider her sins,
        either in general or in particular, without also remembering the Blood
        and the broadness of My mercy, for fear that otherwise she should be
        brought to confusion. And together with confusion would come the Devil,
        who has caused it, under color of contrition and displeasure of sin, and
        so she would arrive at eternal damnation, not only on account of her
        confusion, but also through the despair which would come to her, because
        she did not seize the arm of My mercy. This is one of the subtle devices
        with which the Devil deludes My servants, and, in order to escape from
        his deceit, and to be pleasing to Me, you must enlarge your hearts and
        affections in My boundless mercy, with true humility. You know that the
        pride of the Devil cannot resist the humble mind, nor can any confusion
        of spirit be greater than the broadness of My good mercy, if the soul
        will only truly hope therein. Wherefore it was, if you remember rightly,
        that, once, when the Devil wished to overthrow you, by confusion,
        wishing to prove to you that your life had been deluded, and that you
        had not followed My will, you did that which was your duty, which My
        goodness (which is never withheld from him who will receive it) gave you
        strength to do, that is you rose, humbly trusting in My mercy, and
        saying: 'I confess to my Creator that my life has indeed been passed in
        darkness, but I will hide myself in the wounds of Christ crucified, and
        bathe myself in His Blood and so shall my iniquities be consumed, and
        with desire will I rejoice in my Creator.' You remember that then the
        Devil fled, and, turning round to the opposite side, he endeavored to
        inflate you with pride, saying: 'You are perfect and pleasing to God,
        and there is no more need for you to afflict yourself or to lament your
        sins.' And once more I gave you the light to see your true path, namely,
        humiliation of yourself, and you answered the Devil with these words:
        'Wretch that I am, John the Baptist never sinned and was sanctified in
        his mother's womb. And I have committed so many sins, and have hardly
        begun to know them with grief and true contrition, seeing who God is,
        who is offended by me, and who I am, who offend Him.' Then the Devil,
        not being able to resist your humble hope in My goodness, said to you:
        'Cursed that you are, for I can find no way to take you. If I put you
        down through confusion, you rise to Heaven on the wings of mercy, and if
        I raise you on high, you humble yourself down to Hell, and when I go
        into Hell you persecute me, so that I will return to you no more,
        because you strike me with the stick of charity.' The soul, therefore,
        should season the knowledge of herself with the knowledge of My
        goodness, and then vocal prayer will be of use to the soul who makes it,
        and pleasing to Me, and she will arrive, from the vocal imperfect
        prayer, exercised with perseverance, at perfect mental prayer; but if
        she simply aims at completing her tale, and, for vocal abandons mental
        prayer, she will never arrive at it. Sometimes the soul will be so
        ignorant that, having resolved to say so many prayers vocally, and I,
        visiting her mind sometimes in one way, and sometimes in another, in a
        flash of self-knowledge or of contrition for sin, sometimes in the
        broadness of My charity, and sometimes by placing before her mind, in
        diverse ways, according to My pleasure and the desire of the soul, the
        presence of My Truth, she (the soul), in order to complete her tale,
        will abandon My visitation, that she feels, as it were, by conscience,
        rather than abandon that which she had begun. She should not do so, for,
        in so doing, she yields to a deception of the Devil. The moment she
        feels her mind disposed by My visitation, in the many ways I have told
        you, she should abandon vocal prayer; then, My visitation past, if there
        be time, she can resume the vocal prayers which she had resolved to say,
        but if she has not time to complete them, she ought not on that account
        to be troubled or suffer annoyance and confusion of mind; of course
        provided that it were not the Divine office which clerics and religious
        are bound and obliged to say under penalty of offending Me, for, they
        must, until death, say their office. But if they, at the hour appointed
        for saying it, should feel their minds drawn and raised by desire, they
        should so arrange as to say it before or after My visitation, so that
        the debt of rendering the office be not omitted. But, in any other case,
        vocal prayer should be immediately abandoned for the said cause. Vocal
        prayer, made in the way that I have told you, will enable the soul to
        arrive at perfection, and therefore she should not abandon it, but use
        it in the way that I have told you. 
         And so, with exercise in perseverance, she will taste prayer in
        truth, and the food of the Blood of My only-begotten Son, and therefore
        I told you that some communicated virtually with the Body and Blood of
        Christ, although not sacramentally; that is, they communicate in the
        affection of charity, which they taste by means of holy prayer, little
        or much, according to the affection with which they pray. They who
        proceed with little prudence and without method, taste little, and they
        who proceed with much, taste much. For the more the soul tries to loosen
        her affection from herself, and fasten it in Me with the light of the
        intellect, the more she knows; and the more she knows, the more she
        loves, and, loving much, she tastes much. You see then, that perfect
        prayer is not attained to through many words, but through affection of
        desire, the soul raising herself to Me, with knowledge of herself and of
        My mercy, seasoned the one with the other. Thus she will exercise
        together mental and vocal prayer, for, even as the active and
        contemplative life is one, so are they. Although vocal or mental prayer
        can be understood in many and diverse ways, for I have told you that a
        holy desire is a continual prayer, in this sense that a good and holy
        will disposes itself with desire to the occasion actually appointed for
        prayer in addition to the continual prayer of holy desire, wherefore
        vocal prayer will be made at the appointed time by the soul who remains
        firm in a habitual holy will, and will sometimes be continued beyond the
        appointed time, according as charity commands for the salvation of the
        neighbor, if the soul see him to be in need, and also her own
        necessities according to the state in which I have placed her. Each one,
        according to his condition, ought to exert himself for the salvation of
        souls, for this exercise lies at the root of a holy will, and whatever
        he may contribute, by words or deeds, towards the salvation of his
        neighbor, is virtually a prayer, although it does not replace a prayer
        which one should make oneself at the appointed season, as My glorious
        standard-bearer Paul said, in the words, 'He who ceases not to work
        ceases not to pray.' It was for this reason that I told you that prayer
        was made in many ways, that is, that actual prayer may be united with
        mental prayer if made with the affection of charity, which charity is
        itself continual prayer. I have now told you how mental prayer is
        reached by exercise and perseverance, and by leaving vocal prayer for
        mental when I visit the soul. I have also spoken to you of common
        prayer, that is, of vocal prayer in general, made outside of ordained
        times, and of the prayers of good-will, and how every exercise, whether
        performed in oneself or in one's neighbor, with good-will, is prayer.
        The enclosed soul should therefore spur herself on with prayer, and when
        she has arrived at friendly and filial love she does so. Unless the soul
        keep to this path, she will always remain tepid and imperfect, and will
        only love Me and her neighbor in proportion to the pleasure which she
        finds in My service." 
          
         Of the method by which the soul separates herself from imperfect
        love, and attains to perfect love, friendly and filial. 
          
         "Hitherto I have shown you in many ways how the soul raises
        herself from imperfection and attains to perfection, which she does
        after she has attained to friendly and filial love. I tell you that she
        arrives at perfect love by means of perseverance, barring herself into
        the House of Self-Knowledge, which knowledge of self requires to be
        seasoned with knowledge of Me, lest it bring the soul to confusion, for
        it would cause the soul to hate her own sensitive pleasure and the
        delight of her own consolations. But from this hatred, founded in
        humility, she will draw patience, with which she will become strong
        against the attacks of the Devil, against the persecutions of man, and
        towards Me, when, for her good, I withdraw delight from her mind. And if
        her sensuality, through malevolence, should lift its head against
        reason, the judgment of conscience should rise against it, and, with
        hatred of it, hold out reason against it, not allowing such evil
        emotions to get by it. Though sometimes the soul who lives in holy
        hatred corrects and reproves herself, not only for those things that are
        against reason, but also for things that in reality come from Me, which
        is what My sweet servant S. Gregory meant, when he said that a holy and
        pure conscience made sin where there was no sin, that is, that through
        purity of conscience, it saw sin where there was no sin. 
         "Now the soul who wishes to rise above imperfection should await
        My Providence in the House of Self-Knowledge, with the light of faith,
        as did the disciples, who remained in the house in perseverance and in
        watching, and in humble and continual prayer, awaiting the coming of the
        Holy Spirit. She should remain fasting and watching, the eye of her
        intellect fastened on the doctrine of My Truth, and she will become
        humble because she will know herself in humble and continual prayer and
        holy and true desire." 
          
         Of the signs by which the soul knows she has arrived at perfect love. 
          
         "It now remains to be told you how it can be seen that souls
        have arrived at perfect love. This is seen by the same sign that was
        given to the holy disciples after they had received the Holy Spirit,
        when they came forth from the house, and fearlessly announced the
        doctrine of My Word, My only-begotten Son, not fearing pain, but rather
        glorying therein. They did not mind going before the tyrants of the
        world, to announce to them the truth, for the glory and praise of My
        Name. So the soul, who has awaited Me in self-knowledge as I have told
        you, receives Me, on My return to her, with the fire of charity, in
        which charity, while still remaining in the house with perseverance, she
        conceives the virtues by affection of love, participating in My power;
        with which power and virtues she overrules and conquers her own
        sensitive passions, and through which charity she participates in the
        wisdom of My Son, in which she sees and knows, with the eye of her
        intellect, My Truth and the deceptions of spiritual self-love, that is,
        the imperfect love of her own consolations, as has been said, and she
        knows also the malice and deceit of the devil, which he practices on
        those souls who are bound by that imperfect love. She therefore arises,
        with hatred of that imperfection and with love of perfection, and,
        through this charity, which is of the Holy Spirit, she participates in
        His will, fortifying her own to be willing to suffer pain, and, coming
        out of the house through My Name, she brings forth the virtues on her
        neighbor. Not that by coming out to bring forth the virtues, I mean that
        she issues out of the House of Self-Knowledge, but that, in the time of
        the neighbor's necessity she loses that fear of being deprived of her
        own consolations, and so issues forth to give birth to those virtues
        which she has conceived through affection of love. The souls, who have
        thus come forth, have reached the fourth state, that is, from the third
        state, which is a perfect state, in which they taste charity and give
        birth to it on their neighbors, they have arrived at the fourth state,
        which is one of perfect union with Me. The two last-mentioned states are
        united, that is to say, one cannot be without the other, for there
        cannot be love of Me, without love of the neighbor, nor love of the
        neighbor without love of Me." 
          
         How they who are imperfect desire to follow the Father alone, but
        they who are perfect desire to follow the Son. And of a vision, which
        this holy soul had, concerning diverse baptisms, and of many other
        beautiful and useful things. 
          
         "As I have told you, these latter have issued forth from the
        house, which is a sign that they have arisen from imperfection and
        arrived at perfection. Open the eye of your intellect and see them
        running by the Bridge of the doctrine of Christ crucified, which was
        their rule, way, and doctrine. They place none other before the eye of
        their intellect than Christ crucified, not the Father, as they do who
        are in imperfect love and do not wish to suffer pain, but only to have
        the delight which they find in Me. But they, as if drunken with love and
        burning with it, have gathered together and ascended the three steps,
        which I figured to you as the three powers of the soul, and also the
        three actual steps, figured to you as in the Body of My only Son, Christ
        crucified, by which steps the soul, as I told you, ascended, first
        climbing to the Feet, with the feet of the soul's affection, from thence
        arriving at the Side, where she found the secret of the Heart and knew
        the baptism of water, which has virtue through the Blood, and where I
        dispose the soul to receive grace, uniting and kneading her together in
        the Blood. Where did the soul know of this her dignity, in being kneaded
        and united with the Blood of the Lamb, receiving the grace in Holy
        Baptism, in virtue of the Blood? In the Side, where she knew the fire of
        divine Charity, and so, if you remember well, My Truth manifested to
        you, when you asked, saying: 'Sweet and Immaculate Lamb, You were dead
        when Your side was opened. Why then did You want to be struck and have
        Your heart divided?' And He replied to you, telling you that there was
        occasion enough for it; but the principal part of what He said I will
        tell you. He said: Because My desire towards the human generation was
        ended, and I had finished the actual work of bearing pain and torment,
        and yet I had not been able to show, by finite things, because My love
        was infinite, how much more love I had, I wished you to see the secret
        of the Heart, showing it to you open, so that you might see how much
        more I loved than I could show you by finite pain. I poured from it
        Blood and Water, to show you the baptism of water, which is received in
        virtue of the Blood. I also showed the baptism of love in two ways,
        first in those who are baptized in their blood, shed for Me, which has
        virtue through My Blood, even if they have not been able to have Holy
        Baptism, and also in those who are baptized in fire, not being able to
        have Holy Baptism, but desiring it with the affection of love. There is
        no baptism of fire without the Blood, because the Blood is steeped in
        and kneaded with the fire of Divine charity, because, through love was
        It shed. There is yet another way by which the soul receives the baptism
        of Blood, speaking, as it were, under a figure, and this way the Divine
        charity provided, knowing the infirmity and fragility of man, through
        which he offends, not that he is obliged, through his fragility and
        infirmity, to commit sin unless he wish to do so; but, falling, as he
        will, into the guilt of mortal sin, by which he loses the grace which he
        drew from Holy Baptism in virtue of the Blood, it was necessary to leave
        a continual baptism of Blood. This the Divine charity provided in the
        Sacrament of Holy Confession, the soul receiving the Baptism of Blood,
        with contrition of heart, confessing, when able, to My ministers, who
        hold the keys of the Blood, sprinkling It, in absolution, upon the face
        of the soul. But, if the soul be unable to confess, contrition of heart
        is sufficient for this baptism, the hand of My clemency giving you the
        fruit of this precious Blood. But if you are able to confess, I wish you
        to do so, and if you are able to, and do not, you will be deprived of
        the fruit of the Blood. It is true that, in the last extremity, a man,
        desiring to confess and not being able to, will receive the fruit of
        this baptism, of which I have been speaking. But let no one be so mad as
        so to arrange his deeds, that, in the hope of receiving it, he puts off
        confessing until the last extremity of death, when he may not be able to
        do so. In which case, it is not at all certain that I shall not say to
        him, in My Divine Justice: 'You did not remember Me in the time of your
        life, when you could, now will I not remember you in your death.' 
         "You see then that these Baptisms, which you should all receive
        until the last moment, are continual, and though My works, that is the
        pains of the Cross were finite, the fruit of them which you receive in
        Baptism, through Me, are infinite. This is in virtue of the infinite
        Divine nature, united with the finite human nature, which human nature
        endures pain in Me, the Word, clothed with your humanity. But because
        the one nature is steeped in and united with the other, the Eternal
        Deity drew to Himself the pain, which I suffered with so much fire and
        love. And therefore can this operation be called infinite, not that My
        pain, neither the actuality of the body be infinite, nor the pain of the
        desire that I had to complete your redemption, because it was terminated
        and finished on the Cross, when the Soul was separated from the Body;
        but the fruit, which came out of the pain and desire for your salvation,
        is infinite, and therefore you receive it infinitely. Had it not been
        infinite, the whole human generation could not have been restored to
        grace, neither the past, the present, nor the future. This I manifested
        in the opening of My Side, where is found the secret of the Heart,
        showing that I loved more than I could show, with finite pain. I showed
        to you that My love was infinite. How? By the Baptism of Blood, united
        with the fire of My charity, and by the general baptism, given to
        Christians, and to whomsoever will receive it, and by the baptism of
        water, united with the Blood and the fire, wherein the soul is steeped.
        And, in order to show this, it was necessary for the Blood to come out
        of My Side. Now I have shown you (said My Truth to you) what you asked
        of Me." 
          
         How worldly people render glory and praise to GOD, whether they will
        or no. 
          
         "And so perfect is her vision that she sees the glory and praise
        of My Name, not so much in the angelic nature as in the human, for,
        whether worldly people will or no, they render glory and praise to My
        Name, not that they do so in the way they should, loving Me above
        everything, but that My mercy shines in them, in that, in the abundance
        of My charity, I give them time, and do not order the earth to open and
        swallow them up on account of their sins. I even wait for them, and
        command the earth to give them of her fruits, the sun to give them light
        and warmth, and the sky to move above them. And in all things created
        and made for them, I use My charity and mercy, withdrawing neither on
        account of their sins. I even give equally to the sinner and the
        righteous man, and often more to the sinner than to the righteous man,
        because the righteous man is able to endure privation, and I take from
        him the goods of the world that he may the more abundantly enjoy the
        goods of heaven. So that in worldly men My mercy and charity shine, and
        they render praise and glory to My Name, even when they persecute My
        servants; for they prove in them the virtues of patience and charity,
        causing them to suffer humbly and offer to Me their persecutions and
        injuries, thus turning them into My praise and glory. 
         "So that, whether they will or no, worldly people render to My
        Name praise and glory, even when they intend to do Me infamy and
        wrong." 
          
         How even the devils render glory and praise to GOD. 
          
         "Sinners, such as those of whom I have just spoken, are placed
        in this life in order to augment virtues in My servants, as the devils
        are in Hell as My justiciars and augmenters of My Glory; that is, My
        instruments of justice towards the damned, and the augmenters of My
        Glory in My creatures, who are wayfarers and pilgrims on their journey
        to reach Me, their End. They augment in them the virtues in diverse
        ways, exercising them with many temptations and vexations, causing them
        to injure one another and take one another's property, and not for the
        motive of making them receive injury or be deprived of their property,
        but only to deprive them of charity. But in thinking to deprive My
        servants, they fortify them, proving in them the virtues of patience,
        fortitude, and perseverance. Thus they render praise and glory to My
        Name, and My Truth is fulfilled in them, which Truth created them for
        the praise and glory of Me, Eternal Father, and that they might
        participate in My beauty. But, rebelling against Me in their pride, they
        fell and lost their vision of Me, wherefore they rendered not to Me
        glory through the affection of love, and I, Eternal Truth, have placed
        them as instruments to exercise My servants in virtue in this life and
        as justiciars to those who go, for their sins, to the pains of
        Purgatory. So you see that My Truth is fulfilled in them, that is, that
        they render Me glory, not as citizens of life eternal, of which they are
        deprived by their sins, but as My justiciars, manifesting justice upon
        the damned, and upon those in Purgatory." 
          
         How the soul, after she has passed through this life, sees fully the
        praise and glory of My Name in everything, and, though, in her the pain
        of desire is ended, the desire is not. 
          
         "Thus in all things created, in all rational creatures, and in
        the devils is seen the glory and praise of My Name. Who can see it? The
        soul who is denuded of the body and has reached Me, her End, sees it
        clearly, and, in seeing, knows the truth. Seeing Me, the Eternal Father,
        she loves, and loving, she is satisfied. Satisfied, she knows the Truth,
        and her will is stayed in My Will, bound and made stable, so that in
        nothing can it suffer pain, because it has that which it desired to
        have, before the soul saw Me, namely, the glory and praise of My Name.
        She now, in truth, sees it completely in My saints, in the blessed
        spirits, and in all creatures and things, even in the devils, as I told
        you. And although she also sees the injury done to Me, which before
        caused her sorrow, it no longer now can give her pain, but only
        compassion, because she loves without pain, and prays to Me continually
        with affection of love, that I will have mercy on the world. Pain in her
        is ended, but not love, as the tortured desire, which My Word, the Son,
        had borne from the beginning when I sent Him into the world, terminated
        on the Cross in His painful death, but His love -- no. For had the
        affection of My charity, which I showed you by means of Him, been
        terminated and ended then, you would not be, because by love you are
        made, and had My love been drawn back, that is, had I not loved your
        being, you could not be, but My love created you, and My love possesses
        you, because I am one thing with My Truth, and He, the Word Incarnate
        with Me. You see then, that the saints and every soul in Eternal Life
        have desire for the salvation of souls without pain, because pain ended
        in their death, but not so the affection of love. 
         "Thus, as if drunk with the Blood of the Immaculate Lamb, and
        clothed in the love of the neighbor, they pass through the Narrow Gate,
        bathed in the Blood of Christ crucified, and they find themselves in Me,
        the Sea Pacific, raised from imperfection, far from satiety, and arrived
        at perfection, satisfied by every good." 
          
         How after Saint Paul was drawn to the glory of the blessed, he
        desired to be loosened from the body, as they do, who have reached the
        aforesaid third and fourth states. 
          
         "Paul, then, had seen and tasted this good, when I drew him up
        into the third heaven, that is into the height of the Trinity, where he
        tasted and knew My Truth, receiving fully the Holy Spirit, and learning
        the doctrine of My Truth, the Word Incarnate. The soul of Paul was
        clothed, through feeling and union, in Me, Eternal Father, like the
        blessed ones in Eternal Life, except that his soul was not separated
        from his body, except through this feeling and union. But it being
        pleasing to My Goodness to make of him a vessel of election in the abyss
        of Me, Eternal Trinity, I dispossessed him of Myself, because on Me can
        no pain fall, and I wished him to suffer for My name; therefore I placed
        before him, as an object for the eyes of his intellect, Christ
        crucified, clothing him with the garment of His doctrine, binding and
        fettering him with the clemency of the Holy Spirit and inflaming him
        with the fire of charity. He became a vessel, disposed and reformed by
        My Goodness, and, on being struck, made no resistance, but said: 'My
        Lord, what do You wish me to do? Show me that which it is Your pleasure
        for me to do, and I will do it.' Which I answered when I placed before
        him Christ crucified, clothing him with the doctrine of My charity. I
        illuminated him perfectly with the light of true contrition, by which he
        extirpated his defects, and founded him in My charity." 
          
         How the soul who finds herself in the unitive state desires
        infinitely to have the barren earthly state and unite herself to GOD. 
          
         "And when I depart from the soul in the aforesaid way that the
        body may return a little to its corporal sentiment, the soul, on account
        of the union which she had made with Me, is impatient in her life, being
        deprived of union with Me, and the conversation of the Immortals, who
        render glory to Me, and finding herself, amid the conversation of
        mortals, and seeing them so miserably offending Me. This vision of My
        offense is the torture which such souls always have, and which, with the
        desire to see Me, renders their life insupportable to them.
        Nevertheless, as their will is not their own, but becomes one with Mine,
        they cannot desire other than what I desire, and though they desire to
        come and be with Me, they are contented to remain, if I desire them to
        remain, with their pain, for the greater praise and glory of My Name and
        the salvation of souls. So that in nothing are they in discord with My
        Will; but they run their course with ecstatic desire, clothed in Christ
        crucified, and keeping by the Bridge of His doctrine, glorying in His
        shame and pains. Inasmuch as they appear to be suffering they are
        rejoicing, because the enduring of many tribulations is to them a relief
        in the desire which they have for death, for oftentimes the desire and
        the will to suffer pain mitigates the pain caused them by their desire
        to quit the body. These not only endure with patience, as I told you
        they did, who are in the third state, but they glory, through My Name,
        in bearing much tribulation. In bearing tribulation they find pleasure,
        and not having it they suffer pain, fearing that I reward not their
        well-doing or that the sacrifice of their desires is not pleasing to Me;
        but when I permit to them many tribulations they rejoice, seeing
        themselves clothed with the suffering and shame of Christ crucified.
        Wherefore were it possible for them to have virtue without toil they
        would not want it. They would rather delight in the Cross, with Christ,
        acquiring it with pain, than in any other way obtain Eternal Life. Why?
        Because they are inflamed and steeped in the Blood, where they find the
        blaze of My charity, which charity is a fire proceeding from Me,
        ravishing their heart and mind and making their sacrifices acceptable.
        Wherefore, the eye of the intellect is lifted up and gazes into My
        Deity, when the affection behind the intellect is nourished and united
        with Me. This is a sight which I grant to the soul, infused with grace,
        who, in truth, loves and serves Me." 
          
         How they, who are arrived at the aforesaid unitive state, have the
        eye of their intellect illuminated by supernatural light infused by
        grace. And how it is better to go for counsel for the salvation of the
        soul, to a humble and holy conscience than to a proud lettered man. 
          
         "With this light that is given to the eye of the intellect,
        Thomas Aquinas saw Me, wherefore he acquired the light of much science;
        also Augustine, Jerome, and the doctors, and my saints. They were
        illuminated by My Truth to know and understand My Truth in darkness. By
        My Truth I mean the Holy Scripture, which seemed dark because it was not
        understood; not through any defect of the Scriptures, but of them who
        heard them, and did not understand them. Wherefore I sent this light to
        illuminate the blind and coarse understanding, uplifting the eye of the
        intellect to know the Truth. And I, Fire, Acceptor of sacrifices,
        ravishing away from them their darkness, give the light; not a natural
        light, but a supernatural, so that, though in darkness, they know the
        Truth. Wherefore that, which at first appeared to be dark, now appears
        with the most perfect light, to the gross or subtle mind; and everyone
        receives according as he is capable or disposed to know Me, for I do not
        despise dispositions. So you see that the eye of the intellect has
        received supernatural light, infused by grace, by which the doctors and
        saints knew light in darkness, and of darkness made light. The intellect
        was, before the Scriptures were formed, wherefore, from the intellect
        came science, because in seeing they discerned. It was thus that the
        holy prophets and fathers understood, who prophesied of the coming and
        death of My Son, and the Apostles, after the coming of the Holy Spirit,
        which gave them that supernatural light. The evangelists, doctors,
        professors, virgins, and martyrs were all likewise illuminated by the
        aforesaid perfect light. And everyone has had the illumination of this
        light according as he needed it for his salvation or that of others, or
        for the exposition of the Scriptures. The doctors of the holy science
        had it, expounding the doctrine of My Truth, the preaching of the
        Apostles, and the Gospels of the Evangelists. The martyrs had it,
        declaring in their blood the Most Holy Faith, the fruit and the treasure
        of the Blood of the Lamb. The virgins had it in the affection of charity
        and purity. To the obedient ones is declared, by it, the obedience of
        the Word, showing them the perfection of obedience, which shines in my
        Truth, who for the obedience that I imposed upon Him, ran to the
        opprobrious death of the Cross. This light is to be seen in the Old and
        New Testament; in the Old, by it, were seen by the eye of the intellect,
        and known the prophecies of the holy prophets. In the New Testament of
        the evangelical life, how is the Gospel declared to the faithful? By
        this same light. And because the New Testament proceeded from the same
        light, the new law did not break the old law; rather are the two laws
        bound together, the imperfection of the old law, founded in fear alone,
        being taken from it, by the coming of the Word of My only-begotten Son,
        with the law of Love, completing the old law by giving it love, and
        replacing the fear of penalty by holy fear. And, therefore, said My
        Truth to the disciples, to show that He was not a breaker of laws: 'I
        came not to dissolve the law, but to fulfill it.' It is almost as if My
        Truth would say to them -- The Law is now imperfect, but with My Blood I
        will make it perfect, and I will fill it up with what it lacks, taking
        away the fear of penalty, and founding it in love and holy fear. How was
        this declared to be the Truth? By this same supernatural light, which
        was and is given by grace to all, who will receive it? Every light that
        comes from Holy Scripture comes and came from this supernatural light.
        Ignorant and proud men of science were blind notwithstanding this light,
        because their pride and the cloud of self-love had covered up and put
        out the light. Wherefore they understood the Holy Scripture rather
        literally than with understanding, and taste only the letter of it,
        still desiring many other books; and they get not to the marrow of it,
        because they have deprived themselves of the light, with which is found
        and expounded the Scripture; and they are annoyed and murmur, because
        they find much in it that appears to them gross and idiotic. And,
        nevertheless, they appear to be much illuminated in their knowledge of
        Scripture, as if they had studied it for long; and this is not
        remarkable, because they have of course the natural light from whence
        proceeds science. But because they have lost the supernatural light,
        infused by grace, they neither see nor know My Goodness, nor the grace
        of My servants. Wherefore, I say to you, that it is much better to go
        for counsel for the salvation of the soul, to a holy and upright
        conscience, than to a proud lettered man, learned in much science,
        because such a one can only offer what he has himself, and, because of
        his darkness, it may appear to you, that, from what he says, the
        Scriptures offer darkness. The contrary will you find with My servants,
        because they offer the light that is in them, with hunger and desire for
        the soul's salvation. This I have told you, my sweetest daughter, that
        you might know the perfection of this unitive state, when the eye of the
        intellect is ravished by the fire of My charity, in which charity it
        receives the supernatural light. With this light the souls in the
        unitive state love Me, because love follows the intellect, and the more
        it knows the more can it love. Thus the one feeds the other, and, with
        this light, they both arrive at the Eternal Vision of Me, where they see
        and taste Me, in Truth, the soul being separated from the body, as I
        told you when I spoke to you of the blissfulness that the soul received
        in Me. This state is most excellent, when the soul, being yet in the
        mortal body, tastes bliss with the immortals, and oftentimes she arrives
        at so great a union that she scarcely knows whether she be in the body
        or out of it; and tastes the earnest-money of Eternal Life, both because
        she is united with Me, and because her will is dead in Christ, by which
        death her union was made with Me, and in no other way could she
        perfectly have done so. Therefore do they taste life eternal, deprived
        of the hell of their own will, which gives to man the earnest-money of
        damnation, if he yield to it." 
          
         How this devout soul seeks knowledge from God concerning the state
        and fruit of tears. 
          
         Then this soul, yearning with very great desire, and rising as one
        intoxicated both by the union which she had had with God, and by what
        she had heard and tasted of the Supreme and Sweet Truth, yearned with
        grief over the ignorance of creatures, in that they did not know their
        Benefactor, or the affection of the love of God. And nevertheless she
        had joy from the hope of the promise that the Truth of God had made to
        her, teaching her the way she was to direct her will (and the other
        servants of God as well as herself) in order that He should do mercy to
        the world. And, lifting up the eye of her intellect upon the sweet
        Truth, to whom she remained united, wishing to know somewhat of the
        aforesaid states of the soul of which God had spoken to her, and seeing
        that the soul passes through these states with tears, she wished to
        learn from the Truth concerning the different kinds of tears, and how
        they came to be, and whence they proceeded, and the fruit that resulted
        from weeping. Wishing then to know this from the Sweet, Supreme and
        First Truth, as to the manner of being and reason of the aforesaid
        tears, and inasmuch as the truth cannot be learnt from any other than
        from the Truth Himself, and nothing can be learnt in the Truth but what
        is seen by the eye of the intellect, she made her request of the Truth.
        For it is necessary for him who is lifted with desire to learn the Truth
        with the light of faith. Wherefore, knowing that she had not forgotten
        the teaching which the Truth, that is, God, had given her, that in no
        other way could she learn about the different states and fruits of
        tears, she rose out of herself, exceeding every limit of her nature with
        the greatness of her desire. And, with the light of a lively faith, she
        opened the eye of her intellect upon the Eternal Truth, in whom she saw
        and knew the Truth, in the matter of her request, for God Himself
        manifested it to her, and condescending in His benignity to her burning
        desire, fulfilled her petition. 
          
         How there are five kinds of tears. 
          
         Then said the Supreme and Sweet Truth of God, "Oh, beloved and
        dearest daughter, you beg knowledge of the reasons and fruits of tears,
        and I have not despised your desire; open well the eye of your intellect
        and I will show you, among the aforesaid states of the soul, of which I
        have told you, concerning the imperfect tears caused by fear; but first
        rather of the tears of wicked men of the world. These are the tears of
        damnation. The former are those of fear, and belong to men who abandon
        sin from fear of punishment, and weep for fear. The third are the tears
        of those who, having abandoned sin, are beginning to serve and taste Me,
        and weep for very sweetness; but since their love is imperfect, so also
        is their weeping, as I have told you. The fourth are the tears of those
        who have arrived at the perfect love of their neighbor, loving Me
        without any regard whatsoever for themselves. These weep and their
        weeping is perfect. The fifth are joined to the fourth and are tears of
        sweetness let fall with great peace, as I will explain to you. I will
        tell you also of the tears of fire, without bodily tears of the eyes,
        which satisfy those who often would desire to weep and cannot. And I
        wish you to know that all these various graces may exist in one soul,
        who, rising from fear and imperfect love, reaches perfect love in the
        unitive state. Now I will begin to tell you of these tears in the
        following way." 
          
         Of the difference of these tears, arising from the explanation of the
        aforesaid state of the soul. 
          
         "I wish you to know that every tear proceeds from the heart, for
        there is no member of the body that will satisfy the heart so much as
        the eye. If the heart is in pain the eye manifests it. And if the pain
        be sensual the eye drops hearty tears which engender death, because
        proceeding from the heart, they are caused by a disordinate love
        distinct from the love of Me; for such love, being disordinate and an
        offense to Me, receives the meed of mortal pain and tears. It is true
        that their guilt and grief are more or less heavy, according to the
        measure of their disordinate love. And these form that first class, who
        have the tears of death, of whom I have spoken to you, and will speak
        again. Now, begin to consider the tears which give the commencement of
        life, the tears, that is, of those who, knowing their guilt, set to
        weeping for fear of the penalty they have incurred. 
         "These are both hearty and sensual tears, because the soul, not
        having yet arrived at perfect hatred of its guilt on account of the
        offense thereby done to Me, abandons it with a hearty grief for the
        penalty which follows the sin committed, while the eye weeps in order to
        satisfy the grief of the heart. 
         "But the soul, exercising herself in virtue, begins to lose her
        fear, knowing that fear alone is not sufficient to give her eternal
        life, as I have already told you when speaking of the second stage of
        the soul. And so she proceeds, with love, to know herself and My
        goodness in her, and begins to take hope in My mercy in which her heart
        feels joy. Sorrow for her grief, mingled with the joy of her hope in My
        mercy, causes her eye to weep, which tears issue from the very fountain
        of her heart. 
         "But, inasmuch as she has not yet arrived at great perfection,
        she often drops sensual tears, and if you ask Me why, I reply: Because
        the root of self-love is not sensual love, for that has already been
        removed, as has been said, but it is a spiritual love with which the
        soul desires spiritual consolations or loves some creature spiritually.
        (I have spoken to you at length regarding the imperfections of such
        souls.) Wherefore, when such a soul is deprived of the thing she loves,
        that is, internal or external consolation, the internal being the
        consolation received from Me, the external being that which she had from
        the creature, and when temptations and the persecutions of men come on
        her, her heart is full of grief. And, as soon as the eye feels the grief
        and suffering of the heart, she begins to weep with a tender and
        compassionate sorrow, pitying herself with the spiritual compassion of
        self-love; for her self-will is not yet crushed and destroyed in
        everything, and in this way she lets fall sensual tears -- tears, that
        is, of spiritual passion. But, growing, and exercising herself in the
        light of self-knowledge, she conceives displeasure at herself and
        finally perfect self-hatred. From this she draws true knowledge of My
        goodness with a fire of love, and she begins to unite herself to Me, and
        to conform her will to Mine and so to feel joy and compassion. Joy in
        herself through the affection of love, and compassion for her neighbor,
        as I told you in speaking of the third stage. Immediately her eye,
        wishing to satisfy the heart, cries with hearty love for Me and for her
        neighbor, grieving solely for My offense and her neighbor's loss, and
        not for any penalty or loss due to herself; for she does not think of
        herself, but only of rendering glory and praise to My Name, and, in an
        ecstasy of desire, she joyfully takes the food prepared for her on the
        table of the Holy Cross, thus conforming herself to the humble, patient,
        and immaculate Lamb, My only- begotten Son, of whom I made a Bridge, as
        I have said. Having thus sweetly traveled by that Bridge, following the
        doctrine of My sweet Truth, enduring with true and sweet patience every
        pain and trouble which I have permitted to be inflicted upon her for her
        salvation, having manfully received them all, not choosing them
        according to her own tastes, but accepting them according to Mine, and
        not only, as I said, enduring them with patience, but sustaining them
        with joy, she counts it glory to be persecuted for My Name's sake in
        whatever she may have to suffer. Then the soul arrives at such delight
        and tranquillity of mind that no tongue can tell it. Having crossed the
        river by means of the Eternal Word, that is, by the doctrine of My
        only-begotten Son, and, having fixed the eye of her intellect on Me, the
        Sweet Supreme Truth, having seen the Truth, knows it; and knowing it,
        loves it. Drawing her affection after her intellect, she tastes My
        Eternal Deity, and she knows and sees the Divine nature united to your
        humanity. 
         "Then she reposes in Me, the Sea Pacific, and her heart is
        united to Me in love, as I told you when speaking of the fourth and
        unitive state. When she thus feels Me, the Eternal Deity, her eyes let
        fall tears of sweetness, tears indeed of milk, nourishing the soul in
        true patience; an odoriferous ointment are these tears, shedding odors
        of great sweetness. 
         "Oh, best beloved daughter, how glorious is that soul who has
        indeed been able to pass from the stormy ocean to Me, the Sea Pacific,
        and in that Sea, which is Myself, the Supreme and Eternal Deity, to fill
        the pitcher of her heart. And her eye, the conduit of her heart,
        endeavors to satisfy her heart-pangs, and so sheds tears. This is the
        last stage in which the soul is blessed and sorrowful. 
         "Blessed she is through the union which she feels herself to
        have with Me, tasting the divine love; sorrowful through the offenses
        which she sees done to My goodness and greatness, for she has seen and
        tasted the bitterness of this in her self-knowledge, by which
        self-knowledge, together with her knowledge of Me, she arrived at the
        final stage. Yet this sorrow is no impediment to the unitive state,
        which produces tears of great sweetness through self-knowledge, gained
        in love of the neighbor, in which exercise the soul discovers the plaint
        of My divine mercy, and grief at the offenses caused to her neighbor,
        weeping with those who weep, and rejoicing with those who rejoice --
        that is, who live in My love. Over these the soul rejoices, seeing glory
        and praise rendered Me by My servants, so that the third kind of grief
        does not prevent the fourth, that is, the final grief belonging to the
        unitive state; they rather give savor to each other, for, had not this
        last grief (in which the soul finds such union with Me), developed from
        the grief belonging to the third state of neighborly love, it would not
        be perfect. Therefore it is necessary that the one should flavor the
        other, else the soul would come to a state of presumption, induced by
        the subtle breeze of love of her own reputation, and would fall at once,
        vomited from the heights to the depths. Therefore it is necessary to
        bear with others and practice continually love to one's neighbor,
        together with true knowledge of oneself. 
         "In this way will she feel the fire of My love in herself,
        because love of her neighbor is developed out of love of Me -- that is,
        out of that learning which the soul obtained by knowing herself and My
        goodness in her. When, therefore, she sees herself to be ineffably loved
        by Me, she loves every rational creature with the self-same love with
        which she sees herself to be loved. And, for this reason, the soul that
        knows Me immediately expands to the love of her neighbor, because she
        sees that I love that neighbor ineffably, and so, herself, loves the
        object which she sees Me to have loved still more. She further knows
        that she can be of no use to Me and can in no way repay Me that pure
        love with which she feels herself to be loved by Me, and therefore
        endeavors to repay it through the medium which I have given her, namely,
        her neighbor, who is the medium through which you can all serve Me. For,
        as I have said to you, you can perform all virtues by means of your
        neighbor, I having given you all creatures, in general and in
        particular, according to the diverse graces each has received from Me,
        to be ministered unto by you; you should therefore love them with the
        same pure love with which I have loved you. That pure love cannot be
        returned directly to Me, because I have loved you without being Myself
        loved, and without any consideration of Myself whatsoever, for I loved
        you without being loved by you -- before you existed; it was, indeed,
        love that moved Me to create you to My own image and similitude. This
        love you cannot repay to Me, but you can pay it to My rational creature,
        loving your neighbor without being loved by him and without
        consideration of your own advantage, whether spiritual or temporal, but
        loving him solely for the praise and glory of My Name, because he has
        been loved by Me. 
         "Thus will you fulfill the commandment of the law, to love Me
        above everything, and your neighbor as yourselves. 
         "True indeed is it that this height cannot be reached without
        passing through the second stage, namely the second stage of union which
        becomes the third (and final) stage. Nor can it be preserved when it has
        been reached if the soul abandon the affection from which it has been
        developed, the affection to which the second class of tears belongs. It
        is therefore impossible to fulfill the law given by Me, the Eternal God,
        without fulfilling that of your neighbor, for these two laws are the
        feet of your affection by which the precepts and counsels are observed,
        which were given you, as I have told you, by My Truth, Christ crucified.
        These two states united nourish your soul in virtue, making her to grow
        in the perfection of virtue and in the unitive state. Not that the other
        state is changed because this further state has been reached, for this
        further state does but increase the riches of grace in new and various
        gifts and admirable elevations of the mind, in the knowledge of the
        truth, as I said to you, which, though it is mortal, appears immortal
        because the soul's perception of her own sensuality is mortified and her
        will is dead through the union which she has attained with Me. 
         "Oh, how sweet is the taste of this union to the soul, for, in
        tasting it, she sees My secrets! Wherefore she often receives the spirit
        of prophecy, knowing the things of the future. This is the effect of My
        Goodness, but the humble soul should despise such things, not indeed in
        so far as they are given her by My love, but in so far as she desires
        them by reason of her appetite for consolation, considering herself
        unworthy of peace and quiet of mind, in order to nourish virtue within
        her soul. In such a case let her not remain in the second stage, but
        return to the valley of self-knowledge. I give her this light, My grace
        permitting, so that she may ever grow in virtue. For the soul is never
        so perfect in this life that she cannot attain to a higher perfection of
        love. My only-begotten Son, your Captain, was the only One who could
        increase in no perfection, because He was one thing with Me, and I with
        Him, wherefore His soul was blessed through union with the Divine
        nature. But do you, His pilgrim-members, be ever ready to grow in
        greater perfection, not indeed to another stage, for as I have said, you
        have now reached the last, but to that further grade of perfection in
        the last stage, which may please you by means of My Grace." 
          
         How the four stages of the soul, to which belong the five aforesaid
        states of tears, produce tears of infinite value: and how God wishes to
        be served as the Infinite, and not as anything finite. 
          
         "These five states are like five principal canals which are
        filled with abundant tears of infinite value, all of which give life if
        they are disciplined in virtue, as I have said to you. You ask how their
        value can be infinite. I do not say that in this life your tears can
        become infinite, but I call them infinite, on account of the infinite
        desire of your soul from which they proceed. I have already told you how
        tears come from the heart, and how the heart distributes them to the
        eye, having gathered them in its own fiery desire. As, when green wood
        is on the fire, the moisture it contains groans on account of the heat,
        because the wood is green, so does the heart, made green again by the
        renovation of grace drawn into itself among its self-love which dries up
        the soul, so that fiery desire and tears are united. And inasmuch as
        desire is never ended, it is never satisfied in this life, but the more
        the soul loves the less she seems to herself to love. Thus is holy
        desire, which is founded in love, exercised, and with this desire the
        eye weeps. But when the soul is separated from the body and has reached
        Me, her End, she does not on that account abandon desire, so as to no
        longer yearn for Me or love her neighbor, for love has entered into her
        like a woman bearing the fruits of all other virtues. It is true that
        suffering is over and ended, as I have said to you, for the soul that
        desires Me possesses Me in very truth, without any fear of ever losing
        that which she has so long desired; but, in this way, hunger is kept up,
        because those who are hungry are satisfied, and as soon as they are
        satisfied hunger again; in this way their satiety is without disgust,
        and their hunger without suffering, for, in Me, no perfection is
        wanting. 
         "Thus is your desire infinite, otherwise it would be worth
        nothing, nor would any virtue of yours have any life if you served Me
        with anything finite. For I, who am the Infinite God, wish to be served
        by you with infinite service, and the only infinite thing you possess is
        the affection and desire of your souls. In this sense I said that there
        were tears of infinite value, and this is true as regards their mode, of
        which I have spoken, namely, of the infinite desire which is united to
        the tears. When the soul leaves the body the tears remain behind, but
        the affection of love has drawn to itself the fruit of the tears, and
        consumed it, as happens in the case of the water in your furnace. The
        water has not really been taken out of the furnace, but the heat of the
        fire has consumed it and drawn it into itself. Thus the soul, having
        arrived at tasting the fire of My divine charity, and having passed from
        this life in a state of love towards Me and her neighbor, having further
        possessed that unitive love which caused her tears to fall, does not
        cease to offer Me her blessed desires, tearful indeed, though without
        pain or physical weeping, for physical tears have evaporated in the
        furnace, becoming tears of fire of the Holy Spirit. You see then how
        tears are infinite, how, as regards the tears shed in this life only, no
        tongue can tell what different sorrows may cause them. I have now told
        you the difference between four of these states of tears." 
          
         Of the fruit of worldly men's tears. 
          
         "It remains for Me to tell you of the fruit produced by tears
        shed with desire, and received into the soul. But first will I speak to
        you of that first class of men whom I mentioned at the beginning of this
        My discourse; those, that is, who live miserably in the world, making a
        god of created things and of their own sensuality, from which comes
        damage to their body and soul. I said to you that every tear proceeded
        from the heart, and this is the truth, for the heart grieves in
        proportion to the love it feels. So worldly men weep when their heart
        feels pain, that is, when they are deprived of something which they
        loved. 
         "But many and diverse are their complainings. Do you know how
        many? There are as many as there exist different loves. And inasmuch as
        the root of self-love is corrupt, everything that grows from it is
        corrupt also. Self-love is a tree on which grow nothing but fruits of
        death, putrid flowers, stained leaves, branches bowed down, and struck
        by various winds. This is the tree of the soul. For you are all trees of
        love, and without love you cannot live, for you have been made by Me for
        love. The soul who lives virtuously, places the root of her tree in the
        valley of true humility; but those who live thus miserably are planted
        on the mountain of pride, whence it follows that since the root of the
        tree is badly planted, the tree can bear no fruits of life but only of
        death. Their fruits are their actions, which are all poisoned by many
        and diverse kinds of sin, and if they should produce some good fruit
        among their actions, even it will be spoiled by the foulness of its
        root, for no good actions done by a soul in mortal sin are of value for
        eternal life, for they are not done in grace. Let not, however, such a
        soul abandon on this account its good works, forevery good deed is
        rewarded, and every evil deed punished. A good action performed out of a
        state of grace is not sufficient to merit eternal life, as has been
        said, but My Justice, My Divine Goodness, grants an incomplete reward,
        imperfect as the action which obtains it. Often such a man is rewarded
        in temporal matters; sometimes I give him more time in which to repent,
        as I have already said to you in another place. This also will I
        sometimes do, I grant him the life of grace by means of My servants who
        are pleasing and acceptable to Me. I acted in this way with My glorious
        apostle Paul, who abandoned his infidelity, and the persecutions he
        directed against the Christians, at the prayer of St. Stephen. See
        truly, therefore, that, in whatever state a man may be, he should never
        stop doing good. 
         "I said to you that the flowers of this tree were putrid, and so
        in truth they are. Its flowers are the stinking thoughts of the heart,
        displeasing to Me, and full of hatred and unkindness towards their
        neighbor. So if a man be a thief, he robs Me of honor, and takes it
        himself. This flower stinks less than that of false judgment, which is
        of two kinds. The first with regard to Me, by which men judge My secret
        judgments, gauging falsely all My mysteries, that is, judging that which
        I did in love, to have been done in hatred; that which I did in truth to
        have been done in falsehood; that which I give them for life, to have
        been given them for death. They condemn and judge everything according
        to their weak intellect; for they have blinded the eye of their
        intellect with sensual self-love, and hidden the pupil of the most holy
        Faith, which they will not allow to see or know the Truth. The second
        kind of false judgment is directed against a man's neighbor, from which
        often come many evils, because the wretched man wishes to set himself up
        as the judge of the affections and heart of other rational creatures,
        when he does not yet know himself. And, for an action which he may see,
        or for a word he may hear, he will judge the affection of the heart. My
        servants always judge well, because they are founded on Me, the Supreme
        Good; but such as these always judge badly, for they are founded on
        evil. Such critics as these cause hatreds, murders, unhappinesses of all
        kinds to their neighbors, and remove themselves far away from the love
        of My servants' virtue. 
         "Truly these fruits follow the leaves, which are the words which
        issue from their mouth in insult to Me and the Blood of My only-begotten
        Son, and in hatred to their neighbors. And they think of nothing else
        but cursing and condemning My works, and blaspheming and saying evil of
        every rational creature, according as their judgment may suggest to
        them. The unfortunate creatures do not remember that the tongue is made
        only to give honor to Me, and to confess sins, and to be used in love of
        virtue, and for the salvation of the neighbor. These are the stained
        leaves of that most miserable fault, because the heart from which they
        proceeded was not clean, but all spotted with duplicity and misery. How
        much danger, apart from the spiritual privation of grace to the soul, of
        temporal loss may not occur! For you have all heard and seen how,
        through words alone, have come revolutions of states, and destructions
        of cities, and many homicides and other evils, a word having entered the
        heart of the listener, and having passed through a space not large
        enough for a knife. 
         "I say that this tree has seven branches drooping to the earth,
        on which grow the flowers and leaves in the way I have told you. These
        branches are the seven mortal sins which are full of many and diverse
        wickednesses, contained in the roots and trunk of self-love and of
        pride, which first made both branches and flowers of many thoughts, the
        leaves of words, and the fruits of wicked deeds. They stand drooping to
        the earth because the branches of mortal sin can turn no other way than
        to the earth, the fragile disordinate substance of the world. Do not
        marvel, they can turn no way but that in which they can be fed by the
        earth; for their hunger is insatiable, and the earth is unable to
        satisfy them. They are insatiable and unbearable to themselves, and it
        is conformable to their state that they should always be unquiet,
        longing and desiring that thing which they have to satiety. This is the
        reason why such satiety cannot content them, because they (who are
        infinite in their being) are always desiring something finite; because
        their being will never end, though their life to grace ends when they
        commit mortal sin. 
         "Man is placed above all creatures, and not beneath them, and he
        cannot be satisfied or content except in something greater than himself.
        Greater than himself there is nothing but Myself, the Eternal God.
        Therefore I alone can satisfy him, and, because he is deprived of this
        satisfaction by his guilt, he remains in continual torment and pain.
        Weeping follows pain, and when he begins to weep the wind strikes the
        tree of self-love, which he has made the principle of all his
        being." 
          
         How this devout soul, thanking God for His explanation of the
        above-mentioned states of tears, makes three petitions. 
          
         Then this soul, eager with the greatness of her desire, through the
        sweetness of the explanation and satisfaction which she had received
        from the Truth, concerning the state of tears, said as one enamored --
        "Thanks, thanks be to You, Supreme and Eternal Father, Satisfier of
        holy desires, and Lover of our Salvation, who, through Your Love, gave
        us Love Himself, in the time of our warfare with You, in the person of
        Your only-begotten Son. By this abyss of Your fiery Love, I beg of You
        grace and mercy that I may come to You truly in the light, and not flee
        far in darkness away from Your doctrine, of which You have clearly
        demonstrated to me the truth, so that, by the light thereof, I perceive
        two other points, concerning which I fear that they are, or may become,
        stumbling-blocks to me. I beg, Eternal Father, that, before I leave the
        subject of these states of tears, You would explain these points also to
        me. The first is -- when a person desirous of serving You, comes to me,
        or to some other servant of Yours to ask for counsel, how should I teach
        him? I know, Sweet and Eternal God, that You replied above to this
        question -- 'I am He who takes delight in few words and many deeds.'
        Nevertheless, if it please Your Goodness to grant me a few more words on
        the subject, it will cause me the greatest pleasure. And also, if on
        some occasion, when I am praying for Your creatures, and in particular
        for Your servants, and I seem to see the subjects of my prayer, in one I
        find (in the course of my prayer) a well-disposed mind, a soul rejoicing
        in You; and in another, as it might seem to me, a mind full of darkness;
        have I the right, O Eternal Father, to judge the one soul to be in
        light, and the other in darkness? Or, supposing I should see that the
        one lives in great penance, and the other does not, should I be right to
        judge that he who does the greater penance has the higher perfection? I
        pray You, so that I may not be deceived through my limited vision, that
        You would declare to me in detail, what You have already said in general
        on this matter. The second request I have to make is, that You will
        explain further to me about the sign which You said the soul received on
        being visited by You -- the sign which revealed Your Presence. If I
        remember well, oh, Eternal Truth, You said that the soul remained in joy
        and courageous virtue. I would gladly know whether this joy can consist
        with the delusion of the passion of spiritual self-love; for if it were
        so, I would humbly confine myself to the sign of virtue. These are the
        things which I beg You to tell me, so that I may serve You and my
        neighbor in truth, and not fall into false judgment concerning Your
        creatures and servants. For it seems to me that the habit of judging
        keeps the soul far from You, so I do not wish to fall into this
        snare." 
          
         How the light of reason is necessary to every soul that wishes to
        serve God in truth; and first of the light of reason in general. 
          
         Then the Eternal God, delighting in the thirst and hunger of that
        soul, and in the purity of her heart, and the desire with which she
        longed to serve Him, turned the eye of His benignity and mercy upon her,
        saying -- "Oh, best-beloved, dearest and sweetest daughter, my
        spouse! rise out of yourself, and open the eye of your intellect to see
        Me, the Infinite Goodness, and the ineffable love which I have towards
        you and My other servants. And open the ear of the desire which you feel
        towards Me, and remember, that if you do not see, you can not hear, that
        is to say, that the soul that does not see into My Truth with the eye of
        her intellect, cannot hear or know My Truth, wherefore in order that you
        may the better know it, rise above the feelings of your senses. 
         "And I, who take delight in your request, will satisfy your
        demand. Not that you can increase My delight, for I am the cause of you
        and of your increase; not those of Mine. Yet the very pleasure that I
        take in the work of My own hands causes Me delight." 
         Then that soul obeyed and rose out of herself, in order to learn the
        true solution of her difficulty. And the Eternal God said to her,
        "In order that you may the better understand what I shall say to
        you, I shall revert to the beginning of your request concerning the
        three lights which issue from Me, the True Light. The first is a general
        light dwelling in those who live in ordinary charity. (I shall repeat to
        you here many things concerning these lights, which I have already told
        you, in spite of My having done so, in order that your creeping
        intelligence may better understand that which you wish to know.) The
        other two lights dwell in those who, having abandoned the world, desire
        perfection. Besides this I will explain to you your request, telling you
        in great detail that which I have already pointed out to you in general.
        You know, as I have told you, that, without the light, no one can walk
        in the truth, that is, without the light of reason, which light of
        reason you draw from Me the True Light, by means of the eye of your
        intellect and the light of faith which I have given you in holy baptism,
        though you may have lost it by your own defects. For, in baptism, and
        through the mediation of the Blood of My only-begotten Son, you have
        received the form of faith; which faith you exercise in virtue by the
        light of reason, which gives you life and causes you to walk in the path
        of truth, and, by its means, to arrive at Me, the True Light, for,
        without it, you would plunge into darkness. 
         "It is necessary for you to have two lights derived from this
        primary light, and to these two I will also add a third. The first
        lightens you all to know the transitory nature of the things of the
        world, all of which pass like the wind. But this you cannot know
        thoroughly, unless you first recognize your own fragility, how strong is
        your inclination, through the law of perversity with which your members
        are bound, to rebel against Me, your Creator (not that by this law any
        man can be constrained to commit any, even the smallest sin, against his
        will, but that this law of perversity fights lustily against the
        spirit). I did not impose this law upon you, in order that My rational
        creature should be conquered by it, but in order that he should prove
        and increase the virtue of his soul, because virtue cannot be proved,
        except by its contrary. Sensuality is contrary to the spirit, and yet,
        by means of sensuality, the soul is able to prove the love which she has
        for Me, her Creator. How does she prove it? When, with anger and
        displeasure, she rises against herself. This law has also been imposed
        in order to preserve the soul in true humility. Wherefore you see that,
        while I created the soul to Mine own image and similitude, placing her
        in such dignity and beauty, I caused her to be accompanied by the vilest
        of all things, imposing on her the law of perversity, imprisoning her in
        a body, formed of the vilest substance of the earth, so that, seeing in
        what her true beauty consisted, she should not raise her head in pride
        against Me. Wherefore, to one who possesses this light, the fragility of
        his body is a cause of humiliation to the soul, and is in no way matter
        for pride, but rather for true and perfect humility. So that this law
        does not constrain you to any sin by its strivings, but supplies a
        reason to make you know yourselves and the instability of the world.
        This should be seen by the eye of the intellect, with light of the holy
        faith, of which I said to you that it was the pupil of the eye. This is
        that light which is necessary in general to every rational creature,
        whatever may be his condition, who wishes to participate in the life of
        grace, in the fruit of the Blood of the immaculate Lamb. This is the
        ordinary light, that is, the light which all persons must possess, as
        has been said, for, without it, the soul would be in a state of
        damnation. And, for this reason, because the soul, being without the
        light, is not in a state of grace, inasmuch as, not having the light,
        she does not know the evil of her sin or its cause, and therefore cannot
        avoid or hate it. 
         "And similarly if the soul know not good, and the reason of
        good, that is to say virtue, she cannot love or desire either Me, who am
        the Essential Good, or virtue, which I have given you as an instrument
        and means for you to receive My grace, and Myself the True Good. See
        then how necessary is this light, for your sins consist in nothing else
        than in loving that which I hate, and in hating that which I love. I
        love virtue and hate vice; he who loves vice and hates virtue offends
        Me, and is deprived of My grace. Such a one walks as if blind, for he
        knows not the cause of vice, that is, his sensual self-love, nor does he
        hate himself on account of it; he is ignorant of vice and of the evil
        which follows it: he is ignorant of virtue and of Me, who am the cause
        of his obtaining life-giving virtue; he is ignorant of his own dignity,
        which he should maintain by advancing to grace, by means of virtue. See,
        therefore, how his ignorance is the cause of all his evil, and how you
        also need this light, as has been said." 
          
         Of those who have placed their desire rather in the mortification of
        the body than in the destruction of their own will; and of the second
        light, more perfect than the former general one. 
          
         "When the soul has arrived at the attainment of the general
        light, of which I have spoken, she should not remain contented, because,
        as long as you are pilgrims in this life, you are capable of growth, and
        he who does not go forward, by that very fact, is turning back. She
        should either grow in the general light, which she has acquired through
        My Grace, or anxiously strive to attain to the second and perfect light,
        leaving the imperfect and reaching the perfect. For, if the soul truly
        have light, she will wish to arrive at perfection. In this second
        perfect light are to be found two kinds of perfection; for they may be
        called perfect who have abandoned the general way of living of the
        world. One perfection is that of those who give themselves up wholly to
        the castigation of the body, doing great and severe penance. These, in
        order that their sensuality may not rebel against their reason, have
        placed their desire rather in the mortification of the body than in the
        destruction of their self-will, as I have explained to you in another
        place. These feed their souls at the table of penance, and are good and
        perfect, if their penance be illuminated by discretion, and founded on
        Me, if, that is to say, they act with true knowledge of themselves and
        of Me, with great humility, and wholly conformed to the judgment of My
        Will, and not to that of the will of man. But, if they were not thus
        clothed with My Will, in true humility, they would often offend against
        their own perfection, esteeming themselves the judges of those who do
        not walk in the same path. Do you know why this would happen to them?
        Because they have placed all their labor and desire in the mortification
        of the body, rather than in the destruction of their own will. Such as
        these wish always to choose their own times, and places, and
        consolations, after their own fashion, and also the persecutions of the
        world and of the Devil, as I have narrated to you in speaking of the
        second state of perfection. 
         "They say, cheating themselves with the delusion of their own
        self-will, which I have already called their spiritual self-will, 'I
        wish to have that consolation, and not these battles, or these
        temptations of the Devil, not, indeed, for my own pleasure, but in order
        to please God the more, and in order to retain Him the more in my soul
        through grace; because it seems to me that I should possess Him more,
        and serve Him better in that way than in this.' And this is the way the
        soul often fails into trouble, and becomes tedious and insupportable to
        herself; thus injuring her own perfection; yet she does not perceive it,
        nor that, within her, lurks the stench of pride, and there she lies.
        Now, if the soul were not in this condition, but were truly humble and
        not presumptuous, she would be illuminated to see that I, the Primary
        and Sweet Truth, grant condition, and time, and place, and consolations,
        and tribulations as they may be needed for your salvation, and to
        complete the perfection to which I have elected the soul. And she would
        see that I give everything through love, and that therefore, with love
        and reverence, should she receive everything, which is what the souls in
        the second state do, and, by doing so, arrive at the third state. Of
        whom I will now speak to you, explaining to you the nature of these two
        states which stand in the most perfect light." 
          
         Of the third and most perfect state, and of reason, and of the works
        done by the soul who has arrived at this light. And of a beautiful
        vision which this devout soul once received, in which the method of
        arriving at perfect purity is fully treated, and the means to avoid
        judging our neighbor is spoken of. 
          
         "Those who belong to the third state, which immediately follows
        the last, having arrived at this glorious light, are perfect in every
        condition in which they may be, and receive every event which I permit
        to happen to them with due reverence, as I have mentioned to you when
        speaking of the third and unitive state of the soul. These deem
        themselves worthy of the troubles and stumbling-blocks caused them by
        the world, and of the privation of their own consolation, and indeed of
        whatever circumstance happens to them. And inasmuch as they deem
        themselves worthy of trouble, so also do they deem themselves unworthy
        of the fruit which they receive after their trouble. They have known and
        tasted in the light My Eternal Will, which wishes naught else but your
        good, and gives and permits these troubles in order that you should be
        sanctified in Me. Wherefore the soul having known My Will, clothes
        herself with it, and fixes her attention on nothing else except seeing
        in what way she can preserve and increase her perfection to the glory
        and praise of My Name, opening the eye of her intellect and fixing it in
        the light of faith upon Christ crucified, My only-begotten Son, loving
        and following His doctrine, which is the rule of the road for perfect
        and imperfect alike. And see, how My Truth, the Lamb, who became
        enamored of her when He saw her, gives the soul the doctrine of
        perfection. She knows what this perfection is, having seen it practiced
        by the sweet and amorous Word, My only-begotten Son, who was fed at the
        table of holy desire, seeking the honor of Me, the Eternal Father, and
        your salvation. And, inflamed with this desire, He ran, with great
        eagerness, to the shameful death of the Cross, and accomplished the
        obedience which was imposed on Him by Me, His Father, not shunning
        labors or insults or withdrawing on account of your ingratitude or
        ignorance of so great a benefit, or because of the persecutions of the
        Jews, or on account of the insults, derision, grumbling, and shouting of
        the people. But all this He passed through like the true Captain and
        Knight that He was, whom I had placed on the battle-field to deliver you
        from the hands of the Devil, so that you might be free, and drawn out of
        the most terrible slavery in which you could ever be, and also to teach
        you His road, His doctrine, and His rule, so that you might open the
        Door of Me, Eternal Life, with the key of His precious Blood, shed with
        such fire of love, with such hatred of your sins. It was as if the sweet
        and amorous Word, My Son, should have said to you: 'Behold, I have made
        the road, and opened the door with My Blood.' Do not you then be
        negligent to follow, laying yourselves down to rest in self-love and
        ignorance of the road, presuming to choose to serve Me in your own way,
        instead of in the way which I have made straight for you by means of My
        Truth, the Incarnate Word, and built up with His Blood. Rise up then,
        promptly, and follow Him, for no one can reach Me, the Father, if not by
        Him; He is the Way and the Door by which you must enter into Me, the Sea
        Pacific. "When therefore the soul has arrived at seeing, knowing,
        and tasting, in its full sweetness, this light, she runs, as one
        enamored and inflamed with love, to the table of holy desire; she does
        not see herself in herself, seeking her own consolation either spiritual
        or temporal, but, like one who has placed his all in this light and
        knowledge, and has destroyed his own will, she shuns no labor from
        whatever source it comes, but rather enduring the troubles, the insults,
        the temptations of the Devil, and the murmurings of men, eats at the
        table of the most holy Cross, the food of the honor of Me, the Eternal
        God, and of the salvation of souls; seeking no reward, either from Me or
        from creatures, because she is stripped of mercenary love, that is of
        love for Me based on interested motives, and is clothed in perfect
        light, loving Me in perfect purity, with no other regard than for the
        praise and glory of My Name, serving neither Me for her own delight, nor
        her neighbor for her own profit, but purely through love alone. Such as
        these have lost themselves, and have stripped themselves of the Old Man,
        that is of their own sensuality, and, having clothed themselves with the
        New Man, the sweet Christ Jesus, My Truth, follow Him manfully. These
        are they who sit at the table of holy desire, having been more anxious
        to slay their own will than to slay and mortify their own body. They
        have indeed mortified their body, though not as an end in itself, but as
        a means which helps them to stay their own will, as I said to you when
        explaining that sentence that I wished few words and many deeds, and so
        ought you to do. Their principal desire should be to slay their own
        will, so that it may not seek or wish anything else than to follow My
        sweet Truth, Christ crucified, seeking the honor and glory of My Name
        and the salvation of souls. Those who are in this sweet light know it,
        and remain constantly in peace and quiet, and no one scandalizes them,
        for they have cut away that thing by which stumbling-blocks are caused,
        namely their own will. And all the persecutions, with which the world
        and the Devil can attack them, slide under their feet, standing, as they
        do, in the waters of many tribulations and temptations, and do not hurt
        them, for they remain attached to Me by the umbilical cord of fiery
        desire. Such a man rejoices in everything, nor does he make himself
        judge of My servants, or of any rational creature, but rejoices in every
        condition and in every manner of holiness which he sees, saying: 'Thanks
        be to You, Eternal Father, who have in Your House many mansions.' And he
        rejoices more in the different ways of holiness which he sees, than if
        he were to see all traveling by one road, because, in this way, he
        perceives the greatness of My Goodness become more manifest, and thus,
        rejoicing, draws from all the fragrance of the rose. And not only in the
        case of good, but even when he sees something evidently sinful, he does
        not fall into judgment, but rather into true and holy compassion,
        interceding with Me for sinners and saying, with perfect humility:
        'To-day it is your turn, and tomorrow it will be mine unless the Divine
        Grace preserve me.' 
         "Enamor yourself, dearest daughter, of this sweet and excellent
        state, and gaze at those who run in this glorious light and holiness,
        for they have holy minds, and eat at the table of holy desire, and, with
        the light, have arrived at feeding on the food of souls, that is, the
        honor of Me, the Eternal Father, being clothed with burning love in the
        sweet garment of My Lamb, My only-begotten Son, namely His doctrine.
        These do not lose their time in passing false judgments, either on My
        servants or the servants of the world, and they are never scandalized by
        any murmurings of men, either for their own sake or that of others. That
        is to say, in their own case they are content to endure anything for My
        Name's sake; and when an injury is done to some one else, they endure it
        with compassion of this injured neighbor, and without murmuring against
        him who caused the injury, or him who received it, because their love is
        not disordinate, but has been ordered in Me, the Eternal God. 
         "And, since their love is so ordered, these souls, my dearest
        daughter, never take offense from those they love, nor from any rational
        creature, their will being dead and not alive, wherefore they never
        assume the right to judge the will of men, but only the will of My
        Clemency. These observe the doctrine which, as you know, was given you
        by My Truth at the beginning of your life, when you were thinking in
        what way you could arrive at perfect purity, and were praying to Me with
        a great desire of doing so. You know what was replied to you, while you
        were asleep, concerning this holy desire, and that the words resounded
        not only in your mind, but also in your ear. So much so, that, if you
        remember truly, you returned to your waking body, when My Truth said,
        'Will you arrive at perfect purity, and be freed from stumbling-blocks,
        so that your mind may not be scandalized by anything?' Unite yourself
        always to Me by the affection of love, for I am the Supreme and Eternal
        Purity. I am that Fire which purifies the soul, and the closer the soul
        is to Me, the purer she becomes, and the further she is from Me, the
        more does her purity leave her; which is the reason why men of the world
        fall into such iniquities, for they are separated from Me, while the
        soul, who, without any medium, unites herself directly to Me,
        participates in My Purity. Another thing is necessary for you to arrive
        at this union and purity, namely, that you should never judge the will
        of man in anything that you may see done or said by any creature
        whatsoever, either to yourself or to others. My will alone should you
        consider, both in them and in yourself. And, if you should see evident
        sins or defects, draw out of those thorns the rose, that is to say,
        offer them to Me, with holy compassion. In the case of injuries done to
        yourself, judge that My will permits this in order to prove virtue in
        yourself, and in My other servants, esteeming that he who acts thus does
        so as the instrument of My will; perceiving, moreover, that such
        apparent sinners may frequently have a good intention, for no one can
        judge the secrets of the heart of man. That which you do not see you
        should not judge in your mind, even though it may externally be open
        mortal sin, seeing nothing in others, but My will, not in order to
        judge, but, as has been said, with holy compassion. In this way you will
        arrive at perfect purity, because acting thus, your mind will not be
        scandalized, either in Me or in your neighbor. Otherwise you fall into
        contempt of your neighbor, if you judge his evil will towards you,
        instead of My will acting in him. Such contempt and scandal separates
        the soul from Me, and prevents perfection, and, in some cases, deprives
        a man of grace, more or less according to the gravity of his contempt,
        and the hatred which his judgment has conceived against his neighbor. 
         "A different reward is received by the soul who perceives only
        My will, which, as has been said, wishes nothing else but your good; so
        that everything which I give or permit to happen to you, I give so that
        you may arrive at the end for which I created you. And because the soul
        remains always in the love of her neighbor, she remains always in Mine,
        and thus remains united to Me. Wherefore, in order to arrive at purity,
        you must entreat Me to do three things: to grant you to be united to Me
        by the affection of love, retaining in your memory the benefits you have
        received from Me; and with the eye of your intellect to see the
        affection of My love, with which I love you inestimably; and in the will
        of others to discern My will only, and not their evil will, for I am
        their Judge, not you, and, in doing this, you will arrive at all
        perfection. 
         "This was the doctrine given to you by My Truth, if you remember
        well. Now I tell you, dearest daughter, that such as these, who have
        learnt this doctrine, taste the earnest of eternal life in this life;
        and, if you have well retained this doctrine, you will not fall into the
        snares of the Devil, because you will recognize them in the case about
        which you have asked Me. 
         "But, nevertheless, in order to satisfy your desire more
        clearly, I will tell you and show you how men should never discern by
        judgment, but with holy compassion." 
          
         In what way they, who stand in the above-mentioned third most perfect
        light, receive the earnest of eternal lift in this life. 
          
         "Why did I say to you that they received the earnest of eternal
        life? I say that they receive the earnest-money, but not the full
        payment, because they wait to receive it in Me, the Eternal Life, where
        they have life without death, and satiety without disgust, and hunger
        without pain, for from that divine hunger pain is far away, and though
        they have what they desire, disgust is far from satiety, for I am the
        flawless Food of Life. It is true that, in this life, they receive the
        earnest, and taste it in this way, namely that the soul begins to hunger
        for the honor of the Eternal God, and for the food of the salvation of
        other souls, and being hungry, she eats, that is to say, nourishes
        herself with love of her neighbor, which causes her hunger and desire,
        for the love of the neighbor is a food which never satiates him who
        feeds on it, the eater being insatiable and always remains hungry. So
        this earnest-money is a commencement of a guarantee which is given to
        man, in virtue of which he expects one day to receive his payment, not
        through the perfection of the earnest-money in itself, but through
        faith, through the certitude which he has of reaching the completion of
        his being and receiving his payment. Wherefore this enamored soul,
        clothed in My Truth, having already received in this life the earnest of
        My love, and of her neighbor's, is not yet perfect, but expects
        perfection in immortal life. I say that this earnest is not perfect,
        because the soul who tastes it has not, as yet, the perfection which
        would prevent her feeling pain in herself, or in others. In herself,
        through the offense done to Me by the law of perversity which is bound
        in her members and struggles against the spirit, and in others by the
        offense of her neighbor. She has indeed, in a sense, a perfect grace,
        but not that perfection of My saints, who have arrived at Me, Eternal
        Life, for, as has been said, their desires are without suffering, and
        yours are not. These servants of Mine, as I have said to you in another
        place, who nourish themselves at this table of holy desire, are blessed
        and full of grief, even as My only-begotten Son was, on the wood of the
        holy Cross, because, while His flesh was in grief and torment, His soul
        was blessed through its union with the divine nature. In like manner
        these are blessed by the union of their holy desire towards Me, clothed,
        as has been said, in My sweet Will, and they are full of grief through
        compassion for their neighbor, and because they afflict their own
        self-love, depriving it of sensual delights and consolations." 
          
         How this soul, rendering thanks to God, humiliates herself; then she
        prays for the whole world and particularly for the mystical body of the
        holy Church, and for her spiritual children, and for the two fathers of
        her soul; and, after these things, she asks to hear something about the
        defects of the ministers of the holy Church. 
          
         Then that soul, as if, in truth, inebriated, seemed beside herself,
        as if the feelings of the body were alienated through the union of love
        which she had made with her Creator, and as if, in elevation of mind,
        she had gazed into the eternal truth with the eye of her intellect, and,
        having recognized the truth, had become enamored of it, and said,
        "Oh! Supreme and Eternal Goodness of God, who am I, miserable one,
        that You, Supreme and Eternal Father, have manifested to me Your Truth,
        and the hidden deceits of the Devil, and the deceitfulness of personal
        feeling, so that I, and others in this life of pilgrimage, may know how
        to avoid being deceived by the Devil or ourselves! What moved you to do
        it? Love, because You loved me, without my having loved You. Oh, Fire of
        Love! Thanks, thanks be to You, Eternal Father! I am imperfect and full
        of darkness, and You, Perfection and Light, have shown to me perfection,
        and the resplendent way of the doctrine of Your only-begotten Son. I was
        dead, and You have brought me to life. I was sick, and You have given me
        medicine, and not only the medicine of the Blood which You gave for the
        diseased human race in the person of Your Son, but also a medicine
        against a secret infirmity that I knew not of, in this precept that, in
        no way, can I judge any rational creature, and particularly Your
        servants, upon whom oftentimes I, as one blind and sick with this
        infirmity, passed judgment under the pretext of Your honor and the
        salvation of souls. Wherefore, I thank You, Supreme and Eternal Good,
        that, in the manifesting of Your truth and the deceitfulness of the
        Devil, and our own passions, You have made me know my infirmity.
        Wherefore I beseech You, through grace and mercy, that, from today
        henceforward, I may never again wander from the path of Your doctrine,
        given by Your goodness to me and to whoever wishes to follow it, because
        without You is nothing done. To You, then, Eternal Father, do I have
        recourse and flee, and I do not beseech You for myself alone, Father,
        but for the whole world, and particularly for the mystical body of the
        holy Church, that this truth given to me, miserable one, by You, Eternal
        Truth, may shine in Your ministers; and also I beseech You especially
        for all those whom You have given me, and whom You have made one thing
        with me, and whom I love with a particular love, because they will be my
        refreshment to the glory and praise of Your Name, when I see them
        running on this sweet and straight road, pure, and dead to their own
        will and opinion, and without any passing judgment on their neighbor, or
        causing him any scandal or murmuring. And I pray You, Sweetest Love,
        that not one of them may be taken from me by the hand of the infernal
        Devil, so that at last they may arrive at You, their End, Eternal
        Father. 
         "Also I make another petition to You for my two fathers, the
        supports whom You have placed on the earth to guard and instruct me,
        miserable infirm one, from the beginning of my conversion until now,
        that You unite them, and of two bodies make one soul, and that they
        attend to nothing else than to complete in themselves, and in the
        mysteries that You have placed in their hands, the glory and praise of
        Your Name, and the salvation of souls, and that I, an unworthy and
        miserable slave, and no daughter, may behave to them with due reverence
        and holy fear, for love of You, in a way that will be to Your honor, and
        their peace and quiet, and to the edification of the neighbor. I now
        know for certain, Eternal Truth, that You will not despise the desire of
        the petitions that I have made to You, because I know, from seeing what
        it has pleased You to manifest, and still more from proof, that You are
        the Acceptor of holy desires. I, Your unworthy servant, will strive,
        according as You will give me grace, to observe Your commandments and
        Your doctrine. Now, O Eternal Father, I remember a word which you said
        to me in speaking of the ministers of the holy Church, to the effect
        that You would speak to me more distinctly, in some other place, of the
        sins which they commit today; wherefore if it should please Your
        goodness to tell me anything of this matter, I will gladly hear it, so
        as to have material for increasing my grief, compassion, and anxious
        desire for their salvation; for I remember that You said, that, on
        account of the endurance and tears, the grief, and sweat and prayers of
        Your servants, You would reform the holy Church, and comfort her with
        good and holy pastors. I ask You this in order that these sentiments may
        increase in me." 
          
         How God renders this soul attentive to prayer, replying to one of the
        above-mentioned petitions. 
          
         Then the Eternal God, turning the eye of His mercy upon this soul,
        not despising her desire, but granting her requests, proceeded to
        satisfy the last petition, which she had made concerning His promise,
        saying, "Oh! best beloved and dearest daughter, I will fulfill your
        desire in this request, in order that, on your side, you may not sin
        through ignorance or negligence; for a fault of yours would be more
        serious and worthy of graver reproof now than before, because you have
        learnt more of My truth; wherefore apply yourself attentively to pray
        for all rational creatures, for the mystical body of the holy Church,
        and for those friends whom I have given you, whom you love with
        particular love, and be careful not to be negligent in giving them the
        benefit of your prayers, and the example of your life, and the teaching
        of your words, reproving vice and encouraging virtue according to your
        power. 
         "Concerning the supports which I have given you, of whom you
        spoke to Me, know that you are, in truth, a means by which they may each
        receive, according to their needs and fitness. And as I, your Creator,
        grant you the opportunity, for without Me you can do nothing, I will
        fulfill your desires, but do not you fail, or they either, in your hope
        in Me. My Providence will never fail you, and every man, if he be
        humble, shall receive that which he is fit to receive; and every
        minister, that which I have given him to administer, each in his own
        way, according to what he has received and will receive from My
        goodness." 
          
         Of the dignity of the priest; and of the Sacrament of the Body of
        Christ; and of worthy and unworthy communicants. 
          
         "Now I will reply to that which you asked Me concerning the
        ministers of the holy Church, and, in order that you may the better
        understand the truth, open the eye of your intellect, and look at their
        excellence and the dignity in which I have placed them. And, since one
        thing is better known by means of contrast with its contrary, I will
        show you the dignity of those who use virtuously the treasure I have
        placed in their hands; and, in this way, you will the better see the
        misery of those who today are suckled at the breast of My Spouse."
        Then this soul obediently contemplated the truth, in which she saw
        virtue resplendent in those who truly taste it. Then said the Eternal
        God: "I will first, dearest daughter, speak to you of the dignity
        of priests, having placed them where they are through My Goodness, over
        and above the general love which I have had to My creatures, creating
        you in My image and similitude and re-creating you all to the life of
        grace in the Blood of My only-begotten Son, whence you have arrived at
        such excellence, through the union which I made of My Deity with human
        nature; so that in this you have greater dignity and excellence than the
        angels, for I took your human nature and not that of the angels.
        Wherefore, as I have said to you, I, God, have become man, and man has
        become God by the union of My Divine Nature with your human nature. This
        greatness is given in general to all rational creatures, but, among
        these I have especially chosen My ministers for the sake of your
        salvation, so that, through them, the Blood of the humble and immaculate
        Lamb, My only-begotten Son, may be administered to you. To them have I
        given the Sun to administer, giving them the light of science and the
        heat of Divine Love, united together in the color of the Body and Blood
        of My Son, whose Body is a Sun, because He is one thing with Me, the
        True Sun, in such a way that He cannot be separated or divided from Me,
        as in the case of the natural sun, in which heat and light cannot be
        separated, so perfect is their union; for, the sun, never leaving its
        orbit, lights the whole world and warms whoever wishes to be warmed by
        it, and is not defiled by any impurity on which it shines, for its light
        and heat and color are united. 
         "So this Word, My Son, with His most sweet Blood, is one Sun,
        all God and all man, because He is one thing with Me and I with Him. My
        power is not separated from His wisdom, nor the fiery heat of the Holy
        Spirit from Me, the Father, or from Him, the Son; for He is one thing
        with us, the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son, and We
        together forming one and the same Sun; that is to say, I, the Eternal
        God, am that Sun whence have proceeded the Son and the Holy Spirit. To
        the Holy Spirit is attributed fire and to the Son wisdom, by which
        wisdom My ministers receive the light of grace, so that they may
        administer this light to others, with gratitude for the benefits
        received from Me, the Eternal Father, following the doctrine of the
        Eternal Wisdom, My only-begotten Son. This is that Light, which has the
        color of your humanity, color and light being closely united. Thus was
        the light of My Divinity united to the color of your humanity, which
        color shone brightly when it became perfect through its union with the
        Divine nature, and, by this means of the Incarnate Word mixed with the
        Light of My Divine nature and the fiery heat of the Holy Spirit, have
        you received the Light. Whom have I entrusted with its administration? 
         "My ministers in the mystical body of the holy Church, so that
        you may have life, receiving His Body in food and His Blood in drink. I
        have said to you that this Body is, as it were, a Sun. Wherefore, you
        cannot receive the Body without the Blood, or the Blood or the Body
        without the Soul of the Incarnate Word; nor the Soul, nor the Body,
        without the Divinity of Me, the Eternal God, because none of these can
        be separated from each other, as I said to you in another place that the
        Divine nature never left the human nature, either by death or from any
        other cause. So that you receive the whole Divine Essence in that most
        Sweet Sacrament concealed under the whiteness of the bread; for as the
        sun cannot be divided into light, heat, and color, the whole of God and
        the whole of man cannot be separated under the white mantle of the host;
        for even if the host should be divided into a million particles (if it
        were possible) in each particle should I be present, whole God and whole
        Man. When you break a mirror the reflection to be seen in it is not
        broken; similarly, when the host is divided God and man are not divided,
        but remain in each particle. Nor is the Sacrament diminished in itself,
        except as far as may be in the following example. 
         "If you have a light, and the whole world should come to you in
        order to take light from it -- the light itself does not diminish -- and
        yet each person has it all. It is true that everyone participates more
        or less in this light, according to the substance into which each one
        receives the fire. I will develop this metaphor further that you may the
        better understand Me. Suppose that there are many who bring their
        candles, one weighing an ounce, others two or six ounces, or a pound, or
        even more, and light them in the flame, in each candle, whether large or
        small, is the whole light, that is to say, the heat, the color, and the
        flame; nevertheless you would judge that he whose candle weighs an ounce
        has less of the light than he whose candle weighs a pound. Now the same
        thing happens to those who receive this Sacrament. Each one carries his
        own candle, that is the holy desire, with which he receives this
        Sacrament, which of itself is without light, and lights it by receiving
        this Sacrament. I say without light, because of yourselves you can do
        nothing, though I have given you the material, with which you can
        receive this light and feed it. The material is love, for through love I
        created you, and without love you cannot live. 
         "Your being, given to you through love, has received the right
        disposition in holy baptism, which you receive in virtue of the Blood of
        the Word, for, in no other way, could you participate in this light; you
        would be like a candle with no wick inside it, which cannot burn or
        receive light, if you have not received in your souls the wick which
        catches this Divine Flame, that is to say, the Holy Faith, which you
        receive, by grace, in baptism, united with the disposition of your soul
        created by Me, so fitted for love, that, without love, which is her very
        food, she cannot live. Where does the soul united in this way obtain
        light? At the fire of My Divine love, loving and fearing Me, and
        following the Doctrine of My Truth. It is true that the soul becomes
        more or less lighted according to the material which it brings to the
        fire; for although you all have one and the same material, in that you
        are all created to My image and similitude, and, being Christians,
        possess the light of holy baptism, each of you may grow in love and
        virtue by the help of My grace, as may please you. Not that you change
        the form of what I have given you, but that you increase your strength
        in love, and your free-will, by using it while you have time, for when
        time is past you can no longer do so. So that you can increase in love,
        as has been said, coming with love to receive this Sweet and Glorious
        Light, which I have given you as Food for your service, through My
        ministers, and you receive this Light according to the love and fiery
        desire with which you approach It. 
         "The Light Itself you receive entire, as I have said (in the
        example of those, who in spite of the difference in weight of their
        candles, all receive the entire light), and not divided, because It
        cannot be divided, as has been said, either on account of any
        imperfection of yours who receive, or of the minister; but you
        personally participate in this light, that is in the grace which you
        receive in this Sacrament, according to the holy desire with which you
        dispose yourselves to receive it. He who should go to this sweet
        Sacrament in the guilt of mortal sin, will receive no grace therefrom,
        though he actually receive the whole of God and the whole of Man. Do you
        know the condition of the soul who receives unworthily? She is like a
        candle on which water has fallen, which can do nothing but crackle when
        brought near the flame, for no sooner has the fire touched it, than it
        is extinguished, and nothing remains but smoke; so this soul has cast
        the water of guilt within her mind upon the candle which she received in
        holy baptism, which has drenched the wick of the grace of baptism, and,
        not having heated it at the fire of true contrition and confession, goes
        to the table of the altar to receive this Light with her body, and not
        with her mind, wherefore the Light, since the soul is not disposed as
        she should be for so great a mystery, does not remain by grace in that
        soul, but leaves her, and, in the soul, remains only greater confusion,
        for her light is extinguished and her sin increased by her darkness. Of
        the Sacrament she feels nothing but the crackling of a remorseful
        conscience, not through the defect of the Light Itself, for that can
        receive no hurt, but on account of the water that was in the soul, which
        impeded her proper disposition so that she could not receive the Light.
        See, therefore, that in no way can this Light, united with its heat and
        its color, be divided, either by the scanty desire of the soul when she
        receives the Sacrament, or by any defect which may be in the soul, or by
        any defect of him who administers it, as I told you of the sun which is
        not defiled by shining on anything foul, so the sweet Light of this
        Sacrament cannot be defiled, divided, or diminished in any way, nor can
        it be detached from its orbit. 
         "If all the world should receive in communion the Light and Heat
        of this Sun, the Word, My only-begotten Son, would not be separated from
        Me -- the True Sun, His Eternal Father -- because in His mystical Body,
        the holy Church, He is administered to whoever will receive Him. He
        remains wholly with Me, and yet you have Him, whole God and whole man,
        as I told you, in the metaphor of the light, that, if all the world came
        to take light from it, each would have it entire, and yet it would
        remain whole." 
          
         How the bodily sentiments are all deceived in the aforesaid
        Sacrament, but not those of the soul; therefore it is, with the latter,
        that one must see, taste, and touch It; and of a beautiful vision this
        soul had upon this subject. 
          
         "Oh, dearest daughter, open well the eye of your intellect and
        gaze into the abyss of My love, for there is no rational creature whose
        heart would not melt for love in contemplating and considering, among
        the other benefits she receives from Me, the special Gift that she
        receives in the Sacrament. 
         "And with what eye, dearest daughter, should you and others look
        at this mystery, and how should you touch it? Not only with the bodily
        sight and touch, because in this Sacrament all bodily perceptions fail. 
         "The eye can only see, and the hand can only touch, the white
        substance of the bread, and the taste can only taste the savor of the
        bread, so that the grosser bodily sentiments are deceived; but the soul
        cannot be deceived in her sentiments unless she wish to be -- that is,
        unless she let the light of the most holy faith be taken away from her
        by infidelity. 
         "How is this Sacrament to be truly tasted, seen, and touched?
        With the sentiment of the soul. With what eye is It to be seen? With the
        eye of the intellect if within it is the pupil of the most holy faith.
        This eye sees in that whiteness whole God and whole man, the Divine
        nature united with the human nature, the Body, the Soul, and the Blood
        of Christ, the Soul united to the Body, the Body and the Soul united
        with My Divine nature, not detached from Me, as I revealed to you, if
        you remember well, almost in the beginning of your life; and not so much
        at first through the eye of your intellect as through your bodily eye,
        although the light being so great your bodily eyes lost their vision,
        and only the sight of the eye of your intellect remained. I showed it to
        you for your enlightenment in the battle that the Devil had been waging
        against you in this Sacrament; and to make you increase in love in the
        light of the most holy faith. 
         "You know that you went one morning to church at sunrise to hear
        Mass, having beforehand been tormented by the Devil, and you placed
        yourself upright at the Altar of the Crucifix, while the priest went to
        the Altar of Mary; you stood there to consider your sin, fearing to have
        offended Me through the vexation which the Devil had been causing you,
        and to consider My love, which had made you worthy to hear Mass, seeing
        that you deemed yourself unworthy to enter into My holy temple. When the
        minister came to consecrate, you raised your eyes above his head while
        he was saying the words of consecration, and I manifested Myself to you,
        and you saw issue from My breast a light, like a ray from the sun, which
        proceeds from the circle of the sun without being separated from it, out
        of the midst of which light came a dove and hovered over the host, in
        virtue of the words which the minister was saying. But sight remained
        alone in the eye of your intellect, because your bodily sight was not
        strong enough to stand the light, and in that place you saw and tasted
        the Abyss of the Trinity, whole God and whole man concealed and veiled
        in that whiteness that you saw in the bread; and you perceived that the
        seeing of the Light and the presence of the Word, which you saw
        intellectually in the whiteness of the bread, did not prevent you seeing
        at the same time the actual whiteness of the bread, the one vision did
        not prevent the other vision, that is to say, the sight of the God-Man
        revealed in the bread did not prevent the sight of the bread, for
        neither its whiteness, nor its touch, nor its savor were taken away.
        This was shown you by My goodness, as I have said to you. The eye of the
        intellect had the true vision, using the pupil of the holy faith, for
        this eye should be your principal means of vision, inasmuch as it cannot
        be deceived; wherefore, with it you should look on this Sacrament. How
        do you touch It? By the hand of love. With this hand alone can you touch
        that which the eye of the intellect has recognized in this Sacrament.
        The soul touches Me with the hand of love, as if to certify to herself
        that which she has seen and known through faith. How do you taste It?
        With the palate of holy desire. The corporal palate tastes only the
        savor of the bread; but the palate of the soul, which is holy desire,
        tastes God and Man. See, therefore, that the perceptions of the body are
        deluded, but not those of the soul, for she is illuminated and assured
        in her own perceptions, for she touches with the hand of love that which
        the eye of her intellect has seen with the pupil of holy faith; and with
        her palate -- that is, with fiery desire -- she tastes My Burning
        Charity, My Ineffable Love, with which I have made her worthy to receive
        the tremendous mystery of this Sacrament and the Grace which is
        contained therein. See, therefore, that you should receive and look on
        this Sacrament, not only with bodily perceptions, but rather with your
        spiritual perceptions, disposing your soul in the way that has been
        said, to receive, and taste, and see this Sacrament." 
          
         Of the excellent state of the soul who receives the sacrament in
        grace. 
          
         "See, dearest daughter, in what an excellent state is the soul
        who receives, as she should, this Bread of Life, this Food of the
        Angels. By receiving this Sacrament she dwells in Me and I in her, as
        the fish in the sea, and the sea in the fish -- thus do I dwell in the
        soul, and the soul in Me -- the Sea Pacific. In that soul grace dwells,
        for, since she has received this Bread of Life in a state of grace, My
        grace remains in her, after the accidents of bread have been consumed. I
        leave you the imprint of grace, as does a seal, which, when lifted from
        the hot wax upon which it has been impressed, leaves behind its imprint,
        so the virtue of this Sacrament remains in the soul, that is to say, the
        heat of My Divine charity, and the clemency of the Holy Spirit. There
        also remains to you the wisdom of My only-begotten Son, by which the eye
        of your intellect has been illuminated to see and to know the doctrine
        of My Truth, and, together with this wisdom, you participate in My
        strength and power, which strengthen the soul against her sensual
        self-love, against the Devil, and against the world. You see then that
        the imprint remains, when the seal has been taken away, that is, when
        the material accidents of the bread, having been consumed, this True Sun
        has returned to Its Center, not that it was ever really separated from
        It, but constantly united to Me. The Abyss of My loving desire for your
        salvation has given you, through My dispensation and Divine Providence,
        coming to the help of your needs, the sweet Truth as Food in this life,
        where you are pilgrims and travelers, so that you may have refreshment,
        and not forget the benefit of the Blood. See then how straitly you are
        constrained and obliged to render Me love, because I love you so much,
        and, being the Supreme and Eternal Goodness, deserve your love." 
          
         How the things which have been said about the excellence of this
        Sacrament, have been said that we might know better the dignity of
        priests; and how God demands in them greater purity than in other
        creatures. 
          
         "I have told you all this, dearest daughter, that you may the
        better recognize the dignity to which I have called My ministers, so
        that your grief at their miseries may be more intense. If they
        themselves considered their own dignity they would not be in the
        darkness of mortal sin, or defile the face of their soul. They would not
        only see their offenses against Me, but also, that, if they gave their
        bodies to be burned, they would not repay the tremendous grace and favor
        which they have received, inasmuch as no greater dignity exists in this
        life. They are My anointed ones, and I call them My Christs, because I
        have given them the office of administering Me to you, and have placed
        them like fragrant flowers in the mystical body of the holy Church. The
        angel himself has no such dignity, for I have given it to those men whom
        I have chosen for My ministers, and whom I have appointed as earthly
        angels in this life. In all souls I demand purity and charity, that they
        should love Me and their neighbor, helping him by the ministration of
        prayer, as I said to you in another place. But far more do I demand
        purity in My ministers, and love towards Me, and towards their
        fellow-creatures, administering to them the Body and Blood of My
        only-begotten Son, with the fire of charity, and a hunger for the
        salvation of souls, for the glory and honor of My Name. Even as these
        ministers require cleanness in the chalice in which this Sacrifice is
        made, even so do I require the purity and cleanness of their heart and
        soul and mind. And I wish their body to be preserved, as the instrument
        of the soul in perfect charity; and I do not wish them to feed upon and
        wallow in the mire of filth, or to be inflated by pride, seeking great
        prelacies, or to be cruel to themselves or to their fellow-creatures,
        because they cannot use cruelty to themselves without being cruel to
        their fellow-creatures; for, if by sin they are cruel to themselves,
        they are cruel to the souls of their neighbors, in that they do not give
        them an example of life, nor care to draw them out of the hands of the
        Devil, nor to administer to them the Body and Blood of My only-begotten
        Son, and Me the True Light, as I told you, and the other Sacraments of
        the holy Church. So that, in being cruel to themselves, they are cruel
        to others." 
          
         Of the excellence, virtues, and holy works of virtuous and holy
        ministers; and how such are like the sun. 
          
         "I will now speak to you, in order to give a little refreshment
        to your soul, and to mitigate your grief at the darkness of these
        miserable subjects, of the holy life of some of My ministers, of whom I
        have spoken to you, who are like the sun, for the odor of their virtues
        mitigates the stench of the vices of the others, and the light thereof
        shines in their darkness. And, by means of this light, will you the
        better be able to understand the darkness and sins of My unworthy
        ministers. Open then the eye of your intellect and gaze at the Sun of
        Justice, and you will see those glorious ministers, who, through
        ministering the Sun, have become like to It, as I told you of Peter, the
        prince of the Apostles, who received the keys of the kingdom of Heaven.
        I say the same of these others, who have administered, in the garden of
        the holy Church, the Light, that is to say, the Body and the Blood of My
        only-begotten Son, who is Himself the undivided Sun, as has been said,
        and all the Sacraments of the holy Church, which all give life in virtue
        of the Blood. Each one, placed in a different rank, has administered,
        according to his state, the grace of the Holy Spirit. With what have
        they administered it? With the light of grace, which they have drawn
        from this True Light. With light alone? No; because the light cannot be
        separated from the warmth and color of grace, wherefore a man must
        either have the light, warmth, and color of grace, or none at all. A man
        in mortal sin is deprived of the life of grace, and he who is in grace
        has illuminated the eye of his intellect to know Me, who gave him both
        grace and the virtue which preserves it, and, in that light, he knows
        the misery and the reason of sin, that is to say, his own self-love, on
        which account he hates it, and thereby receives the warmth of Divine
        love into his affection, which follows his intellect, and he receives
        the color of this glorious Light, following the doctrine of My sweet
        Truth, by which his memory is filled with the benefit of the Blood. You
        see, therefore, that no one can receive the light without receiving the
        warmth and the color, for they are united together and are one thing;
        wherefore he cannot, as I have said to you, have one power of his soul
        so ordered as to receive Me, the True Sun, unless all three powers of
        his soul are brought together and ordered in My Name. For, as soon as
        the eye of the intellect lifts itself with the pupil of faith above
        sensual vision in the contemplation of Me, affection follows it, loving
        that which the intellect sees and knows, and the memory is filled with
        that which the affection loves; and, as soon as these powers are thus
        disposed, the soul participates in Me, the Sun who illuminates her with
        My power, and with the wisdom of My only-begotten Son, and the fiery
        clemency of the Holy Spirit. See, then, that these have taken on them
        the condition of the Sun, for, having clothed themselves, and filled the
        power of their soul with Me, the true Sun, they become like Me. The Sun
        illuminates them and causes the earth of their souls to germinate with
        Its heat. Thus do My sweet ministers, elected and anointed and placed in
        the mystical body of the holy Church, in order to administer Me, the
        Sun, that is to say, the Body and Blood of My only-begotten Son,
        together with the other Sacraments, which draw their life from this
        Blood; this they do in two ways, actually, in administering the
        Sacraments, and spiritually, by shedding forth in the mystical body of
        the holy Church, the light of supernatural science, together with the
        color of an honorable and holy life, following the doctrine of My Truth,
        which they administer in the ardent love with which they cause barren
        souls to bear fruit, illuminating them with the light of their science,
        and driving away the darkness of their mortal sin and infidelity, by the
        example of their holy and regular life, and reforming the lives of those
        who live in disorder and darkness of sin, and in coldness, through the
        privation of charity. So you see that they are the Sun, because they
        have taken the condition of the Sun from Me, the True Sun, because,
        through affection of love, they are one thing with Me, and I with them,
        as I narrated to you in another place, and each one has given light in
        the holy Church, according to the position to which I have elected him:
        Peter with preaching and doctrine, and in the end with blood; Gregory
        with science, and holy scripture, and with the mirror of his life;
        Sylvester, against the infidels, and with disputation and proving of the
        most holy faith, which he made in word and in deed, receiving virtue
        from Me. If you turn to Augustine, and to the glorious Thomas and
        Jerome, and the others, you will see how much light they have thrown
        over this spouse, extirpating error, like lamps placed upon the
        candelabra, with true and perfect humility. And, as if famished for such
        food, they feed upon My honor, and the salvation of souls, upon the
        table of the most holy Cross. The martyrs, indeed, with blood, which
        blood cast up sweet perfume before My countenance; and, with the perfume
        of blood, and of the virtues, and with the light of science, they
        brought forth fruit in this spouse and extended the faith, and, by their
        means, the light of the most holy faith was rekindled in the darkened.
        And prelates, placed in the position of the prelacy of Christ on earth,
        offered Me the sacrifice of justice with holy and upright lives. The
        pearl of justice, with true humility, and most ardent love, shone in
        them, and in their subjects, with the light of discretion. In them,
        principally because they justly paid Me My due, in rendering glory and
        praise to My Name, and, to their own sensuality, hatred and displeasure,
        despising vice and embracing virtue, with love of Me and of their
        neighbor. With humility they trampled on pride, and, with purity of
        heart and of body, came, like angels, to the table of the altar, and,
        with sincerity of mind, celebrated, burning in the furnace of love. And,
        because they first had done justice to themselves, they therefore did
        justice to those under them, wishing to see them live virtuously, and
        correcting them without any servile fear, because they were not thinking
        of themselves, but solely of My honor and the salvation of souls, like
        good shepherds, followers of the Good Shepherd, My Truth, whom I gave
        you to lead your sheep, having willed that He should give His life for
        you. These have followed His footsteps, and therefore did they correct
        them, and did not let their members become putrid for want of
        correcting, but they charitably corrected them with the unction of
        benignity, and with the sharpness of fire, cauterizing the wound of sin
        with reproof and penance, little or much, according to the graveness of
        the fault. And, in order to correct it and to speak the truth, they did
        not even fear death. They were true gardeners who, with care and holy
        tears, took away the thorns of mortal sins, and planted plants
        odoriferous of virtue. Wherefore, those under them lived in holy, true
        fear, and grew up like sweet smelling flowers in the mystic body of the
        holy Church (because they were not deprived of correction, and so were
        not guilty of sin), for My gardeners corrected them without any servile
        fear, being free from it, and without any sin, for they balanced exactly
        the scales of holy justice, reproving humbly and without human respect.
        And this justice was and is that pearl which shines in them, and which
        gave peace and light in the minds of the people and caused holy fear to
        be with them, and unity of hearts. And I would that you know that, more
        darkness and division have come into the world amongst seculars and
        religious and the clergy and pastors of the holy Church, through the
        lack of the light of justice, and the advent of the darkness of
        injustice, than from any other causes. 
         "Neither the civil law, nor the divine law, can be kept in any
        degree without holy justice, because he who is not corrected, and does
        not correct others, becomes like a limb which putrefies, and corrupts
        the whole body, because the bad physician, when it had already begun to
        corrupt, placed ointment immediately upon it, without having first burnt
        the wound. So, were the prelate, or any other lord having subjects, on
        seeing one putrefying from the corruption of mortal sin, to apply to him
        the ointment of soft words of encouragement alone, without reproof, he
        would never cure him, but the putrefaction would rather spread to the
        other members, who, with him, form one body under the same pastor. But
        if he were a physician, good and true to those souls, as were those
        glorious pastors of old, he would not give salving ointment without the
        fire of reproof. And, were the member still to remain obstinate in his
        evil doing, he would cut him off from the congregation in order that he
        corrupt not the other members with the putrefaction of mortal sin. But
        they act not so today, but, in cases of evil doing, they even pretend
        not to see. And do you know why? The root of self-love is alive in them,
        wherefore they bear perverted and servile fear. Because they fear to
        lose their position or their temporal goods, or their prelacy, they do
        not correct, but act like blind ones, in that they see not the real way
        by which their position is to be kept. If they would only see that it is
        by holy justice they would be able to maintain it; but they do not,
        because they are deprived of light. But, thinking to preserve their
        position with injustice, they do not reprove the faults of those under
        them; and they are deluded by their own sensitive self-love, or by their
        desire for lordship and prelacy, and they correct not the faults they
        should correct in others, because the same or greater ones are their
        own. They feel themselves comprehended in the guilt, and they therefore
        lose all ardor and security, and, fettered by servile fear, they make
        believe not to see. And, moreover, if they do see they do not correct,
        but allow themselves to be bound over with flattering words and with
        many presents, and they themselves find the excuse for the guilty ones
        not to be punished. In such as these are fulfilled the words spoken by
        My Truth, saying: 'These are blind and leaders of the blind, and if the
        blind lead the blind, they both fall into the ditch.' My sweet
        ministers, of whom I spoke to you, who have the properties and condition
        of the sun, did not, and do not (if there be any now) act so. And they
        are truly suns, as I have told you, because in them is no darkness of
        sin, or of ignorance, because they follow the doctrine of My Truth. They
        are not tepid, because they burn in the furnace of My love, and because
        they are despisers of the grandeurs, positions, and delights of the
        world. They fear not to correct, for he who does not desire lordship or
        prelacy will not fear to lose it, and will reprove manfully, and he
        whose conscience does not reprove him of guilt, does not fear. 
         "And therefore this pearl of justice was not dimmed in My
        anointed ones, My Christs (of whom I have narrated to you), but was
        resplendent in them, wherefore they embraced voluntary poverty, and
        sought out vileness with profound humility, and cared not for scorn or
        villainies, or the detractions of men, or insult, or opprobrium, or
        pain, or torment. 
         "They were cursed, and they blessed, and, with true patience,
        they bore themselves like terrestrial angels, not by nature, but by
        their ministry, and the supernatural grace given to them, of
        administering the Body and Blood of My only-begotten Son. And they are
        truly angels. Because, as the angel, which I give you to be your
        guardian, ministers to you holy and good inspirations, so were these
        ministers angels, and were given by My goodness to be guardians, and
        therefore had they their eye continually over those under them, like
        real guardian angels, inspiring in their hearts holy and good thoughts,
        and offering up for them before Me, sweet and amorous desires with
        continual prayer, and the doctrine of words, and with example of life.
        So you see that they are angels, placed by My burning love, like
        lanterns in the mystic body of the holy Church, to be your guardians, so
        that you blind ones may have guides to direct you into the way of truth,
        giving you good inspirations, with prayers and example of life, and
        doctrine as I said. With how much humility did they govern those under
        them, and converse with them! With how much hope and lively faith, and
        therefore with liberality, did they distribute to the poor the substance
        of the holy Church, not fearing, or caring if for them and their
        subjects temporal substance diminished. And they scarcely observed that
        which they were really bound to do, that is, to distribute the temporal
        substance to their own necessity being the poor in the Church. They
        saved nothing, and after their death there remained no money at all, and
        there were some even who, for the sake of the poor, left the Church in
        debt. This was because through the largeness of their charity, and of
        the hope that they had placed in My Providence, they were without
        servile fear that anything should diminish to them, either spiritual or
        temporal. 
         "The sign that a creature hopes in Me and not in himself, is
        that he does not fear with a servile fear. They who hope in themselves
        are the ones who fear, and are afraid of their own shadow, and doubt
        lest the sky and earth fade away before them. With such fears as these,
        and a perverted hope in their own small knowledge, they spend so much
        miserable solicitude in acquiring and preserving temporal things, that
        they turn their back on the spiritual, caring not for them. But they,
        miserable, faithless, proud ones consider not that I alone am He who
        provides all things necessary for the soul and the body, and that with
        the same measure that My creatures hope in Me, will My providence be
        measured to them. The miserable presumptuous ones do not regard the fact
        that I am He who is, and they are they who are not, and that they have
        received their being, and every other additional grace, from My
        Goodness. And therefore his labor may be reputed to be in vain, who
        watches the city if it be not guarded by Me. All his labor will be vain,
        if he thinks by his labor or solicitude to keep it, because I alone keep
        it. It is true that I desire you to use your being, and exercise the
        graces which I have bestowed upon you, in virtue using the free-will
        which I have given you, with the light of reason, because though I
        created you without your help I will not save you without it. I loved
        you before you were, and those My beloved ones saw and knew this, and
        therefore they loved Me ineffably, and through their love hoped so
        greatly in Me that they feared nothing. Sylvester feared not when he
        stood before the Emperor Constantine disputing with those twelve Jews
        before the whole crowd, but with lively faith he believed that I being
        for him, no one could be against him; and in the same way the others all
        lost their every fear, because they were not alone but were accompanied,
        because being in the enjoyment of love, they were in Me, and from Me
        they acquired the light of the wisdom of My only-begotten Son, and from
        Me they received the faculty to be strong and powerful against the
        princes and tyrants of the world, and from Me they had the fire of the
        Holy Spirit, sharing the clemency and burning love of that Spirit. 
         "This love was and is the companion of whosoever desires it,
        with the light of faith, with hope, with fortitude, true patience and
        long perseverance even until death. So you see that because they were
        not alone but were accompanied they feared nothing. He only who feels
        himself to be alone, and hopes in himself, deprived of the affection of
        love, fears, and is afraid of every little thing, because he alone is
        without Me who give supreme security to the soul who possesses Me
        through the affection of love. And of this did those glorious ones, My
        beloved, have full experience, for nothing could injure their souls; but
        they on the contrary could injure men and the devils, who oftentimes
        remained bound by the virtue and power that I had given My servants over
        them. This was because I responded to the love, faith, and hope they had
        placed in Me. Your tongue would not be sufficient to relate their
        virtues, neither the eye of your intellect to see the fruit which they
        receive in everlasting life, and that all will receive who follow in
        their footsteps. They are like precious stones, and as such do they
        stand in My presence, because I have received their labor and poverty
        and the light which they shed with the odor of virtues in the mystic
        body of the holy Church. And in the life eternal I have placed them in
        the greatest dignity, and they receive blessing and glory in My sight,
        because they gave the example of an honorable and holy life, and with
        light administered the Light of the Body and Blood of My only-begotten
        Son, and all the Sacraments. And these My anointed ones and ministers
        are peculiarly beloved by Me, on account of the dignity which I placed
        in them, and because this Treasure which I placed in their hands they
        did not hide through negligence and ignorance, but rather recognized it
        to be from Me, and exercised it with care and profound humility with
        true and real virtues; and because I, for the salvation of souls, having
        placed them in so much excellency they never rested like good shepherds
        from putting the sheep into the fold of the holy Church, and even out of
        love and hunger for souls they gave themselves to die, to get them out
        of the hands of the devil. They made themselves infirm with those who
        were infirm, so that they might not be overcome with despair, and to
        give them more courage in exposing their infirmity, they would
        oftentimes lend countenance to their infirmity and say, 'I, too, am
        infirm with you.' They wept with those who wept, and rejoiced with those
        who rejoiced; and thus sweetly they knew to give everyone his
        nourishment, preserving the good and rejoicing in their virtues, not
        being gnawed by envy, but expanded with the broadness of love for their
        neighbors, and those under them. They drew the imperfect ones out of
        imperfection, themselves becoming imperfect and infirm with them, as I
        told you, with true and holy compassion, and correcting them and giving
        them penance for the sins they committed -- they through love endured
        their penance -- together with them. For through love, they who gave the
        penance, bore more pain than they who received it; and there were even
        those who actually performed the penance, and especially when they had
        seen that it had appeared particularly difficult to the penitent.
        Wherefore by that act the difficulty became changed into sweetness. 
         "Oh! My beloved ones, they made themselves subjects, being
        prelates, they made themselves servants, being lords, they made
        themselves infirm, being whole, and without infirmity and the leprosy of
        mortal sin, being strong they made themselves weak, with the foolish and
        simple they showed themselves simple, and with the small insignificant.
        And so with love they knew how to be all things to all men, and to give
        to each one his nourishment. What caused them to do thus? The hunger and
        desire for My honor and the salvation of souls which they had conceived
        in Me. They ran to feed on it at the table of the holy Cross, not
        fleeing from or refusing any labor, but with zeal for souls and for the
        good of the holy Church and the spread of the faith, they put themselves
        in the midst of the thorns of tribulation, and exposed themselves to
        every peril with true patience, offering incense odoriferous with
        anxious desires, and humble and continual prayers. With tears and sweat
        they anointed the wounds of their neighbor, that is the wounds of the
        guilt of mortal sin, which latter were perfectly cured, the ointment so
        made, being received in humility." 
          
         A brief repetition of the preceding chapter; and of the reverence
        which should be paid to priests, whether they are good or bad. 
          
         "I have shown you, dearest daughter, a sample of the excellence
        of good priests (for what I have shown you is only a sample of what that
        excellence really is), and I have told you of the dignity in which I
        have placed them, having elected them for My ministers, on account of
        which dignity and authority I do not wish them to be punished by the
        hand of seculars on account of any personal defect, for those who punish
        them offend Me miserably. But I wish seculars to hold them in due
        reverence, not for their own sakes, as I have said, but for Mine, by
        reason of the authority which I have given them. Wherefore this
        reverence should never diminish in the case of priests whose virtue
        grows weak, any more than in the case of those virtuous ones of whose
        goodness I have spoken to you; for all alike have been appointed
        ministers of the Sun -- that is of the Body and Blood of My Son, and of
        the other Sacraments. 
         "This dignity belongs to good and bad alike -- all have the Sun
        to administer, as has been said, and perfect priests are themselves in a
        condition of light, that is to say, they illuminate and warm their
        neighbors through their love. And with this heat they cause virtues to
        spring up and bear fruit in the souls of their subjects. I have
        appointed them to be in very truth your guardian angels to protect you;
        to inspire your hearts with good thoughts by their holy prayers, and to
        teach you My doctrine reflected in the mirror of their life, and to
        serve you by administering to you the holy Sacraments, thus serving you,
        watching over you, and inspiring you with good and holy thoughts as does
        an angel. 
         "See, then, that besides the dignity to which I have appointed
        them, how worthy they are of being loved; when they also possess the
        adornment of virtue, as did those of whom I spoke to you, which are all
        bound and obliged to possess, and in what great reverence you should
        hold them, for they are My beloved children and shine each as a sun in
        the mystical body of the holy Church by their virtues, forevery virtuous
        man is worthy of love, and these all the more by reason of the ministry
        which I have placed in their hands. You should love them therefore by
        reason of the virtue and dignity of the Sacrament, and by reason of that
        very virtue and dignity you should hate the defects of those who live
        miserably in sin, but not on that account appoint yourselves their
        judges, which I forbid, because they are My Christs, and you ought to
        love and reverence the authority which I have given them. You know well
        that if a filthy and badly dressed person brought you a great treasure
        from which you obtained life, you would not hate the bearer, however
        ragged and filthy he might be, through love of the treasure and of the
        lord who sent it to you. His state would indeed displease you, and you
        would be anxious through love of his master that he should be cleansed
        from his foulness and properly clothed. This, then, is your duty
        according to the demands of charity, and thus I wish you to act with
        regard to such badly ordered priests, who themselves filthy and clothed
        in garments ragged with vice through their separation from My love,
        bring you great Treasures -- that is to say, the Sacraments of the holy
        Church -- from which you obtain the life of grace, receiving Them
        worthily (in spite of the great defects there may be in them) through
        love of Me, the Eternal God, who send them to you, and through love of
        that life of grace which you receive from the great treasure, by which
        they administer to you the whole of God and the whole of Man, that is to
        say, the Body and Blood of My Son united to My Divine nature. Their sins
        indeed should displease you, and you should hate them, and strive with
        love and holy prayer to re-clothe them, washing away their foulness with
        your tears -- that is to say, that you should offer them before Me with
        tears and great desire, that I may re-clothe them in My goodness, with
        the garment of charity. Know well that I wish to do them grace, if only
        they will dispose themselves to receive it, and you to pray for it; for
        it is not according to My will that they should administer to you the
        Sun being themselves in darkness, not that they should be stripped of
        the garment of virtue, foully living in dishonor; on the contrary I have
        given them to you, and appointed them to be earthly angels and suns, as
        I have said. It not being My will that they should be in this state, you
        should pray for them, and not judge them, leaving their judgment to Me.
        And I, moved by your prayers, will do them mercy if they will only
        receive it, but if they do not correct their life, their dignity will be
        the cause of their ruin. For if they do not accept the breadth of My
        mercy, I, the Supreme Judge, shall terribly condemn them at their last
        extremity, and they will be sent to the eternal fire." 
          
         Of the difference between the death of a just man and that of a
        sinner, and first of the death of the just man. 
          
         "Having told you how the world and the devils accuse these
        wretches, which is indeed the truth, I wish to speak to you in more
        detail on this point (so that you may have greater compassion on these
        poor wretches), telling you how different are the struggles of the soul
        of a just man to those of a sinner, and how different are their deaths,
        and how the peace of the just man's death is greater or less according
        to the perfection of his soul. For I wish you to know that all the
        sufferings which rational creatures endure depend on their will, because
        if their will were in accordance with mine they would endure no
        suffering, not that they would have no labors on that account, but
        because labors cause no suffering to a will which gladly endures them,
        seeing that they are ordained by My will. Such men as these wage war
        with the world, the Devil, and their own sensuality through holy hatred
        of themselves. Wherefore when they come to the point of death, they die
        peacefully, because they have vanquished their enemies during their
        life. The world cannot accuse such a man, because he saw through its
        deceptions and therefore renounced it with all its delights. His sensual
        fragility and his body do not accuse him, because he bound sensuality
        like a slave with the rein of reason, macerating his flesh with penance,
        with watchings, and humble and continual prayer. The will of his senses
        he slew with hatred and dislike of vice, and with love of virtue. He has
        entirely lost all tenderness for his body, which tenderness and love
        between the soul and the body makes death seem difficult, and on account
        of it man naturally fears death; but since the virtue of a just and
        perfect man transcends nature, extinguishing his natural fear and
        overcoming it with holy hatred of himself and desire of arriving at his
        last end, his natural tenderness cannot make war on him, and his
        conscience remains in peace; for during his life his conscience kept a
        good guard, warning him when enemies were coming to attack the city of
        his soul, like a watch-dog which stands at the door, and when it sees
        enemies warns the guards by its barking, for in this way the dog of
        conscience warns the sentry of reason, and the reason together with the
        free-will know by the light of the intellect whether the stranger be
        friend or enemy. To a friend, that is to say, to virtue and holy
        thoughts, he gave his delighted love, receiving and using these with
        great solicitude; to an enemy, that is to say, to vice and wicked
        thoughts, he gave hatred and displeasure. And with the knife of hatred
        of self, and love of Me, and with the light of reason, and the hand of
        free- will he struck his enemies; so that at the point of death his
        conscience, having been a faithful guardian, does not gnaw but remains
        in peace. 
         "It is true that a just soul, through humility, and because at
        the moment of death she realizes better the value of time and of the
        jewels of virtue, reproves herself, seeming to herself to have used her
        time but little; but this is not an afflictive pain, but rather
        profitable, for the soul recollected in herself, is caused by it to
        throw herself before the Blood of the humble and immaculate Lamb My Son.
        The just man does not turn his head to admire his past virtues, because
        he neither can nor will hope in his own virtues, but only in the Blood
        in which he has found mercy; and as he lived in the memory of that
        Blood, so in death he is inebriated and drowned in the same. How is it
        that the devils cannot reprove him of sin? Because during his life he
        conquered their malice with wisdom, yet they come round him to see if
        they can acquire anything, and appear in horrible shapes in order to
        frighten him with hideous aspect, and many diverse phantasms, but the
        poison of sin not being in his soul, their aspect causes him no terror
        or fear, as it would do to another who had lived wickedly in the world.
        Wherefore the devils, seeing that the soul has entered into the Blood
        with ardent love, cannot endure the sight, but stand afar off shooting
        their arrows. But their war and their shouts cannot hurt that soul, who
        already is beginning to taste eternal life, as I said to you in another
        place, for with the eye of the intellect illuminated by the pupil of the
        holy faith, she sees Me, the Infinite and Eternal Good, whom she hopes
        to obtain by grace, not as her due, but by virtue of Jesus Christ My
        Son. 
         "Wherefore opening the arms of hope and seizing Him with the
        hands of love, she seems to enter into His possession before she
        actually does so, in the way which I have narrated to you in another
        place. Passing suddenly, drowned in the Blood, by the narrow door of the
        Word she reaches Me, the Sea Pacific. For sea and door are united
        together. I and the Truth, My only-begotten Son being one and the same
        thing. What joy such a soul receives who sees herself so sweetly arrived
        at this pass, for in Truth she tastes the happiness of the angelic
        nature! This joy is received by all those who pass in this sweet manner,
        but to a far greater extent by My ministers, of whom I spoke to you, who
        have lived like angels, for in this life have they lived with greater
        knowledge, and with greater hunger for the salvation of souls. I do not
        speak only of the light of virtue which all can have in general, but of
        the supernatural light which these men possessed over and above the
        light of virtuous living, the light, that is, of holy science, by which
        science they knew more of My Truth, and he who knows more loves Me more,
        and he who loves Me more receives more. Your reward is measured
        according to the measure of your love, and if you should ask Me, whether
        one who has no science can attain to this love, I should reply, yes it
        is possible that he may attain to it, but an individual case does not
        make a general law and I always discourse to you in general. 
         "They also receive greater dignity on account of their
        priesthood, because they have personally received the office of eating
        souls in My honor. For just as everyone has the office of remaining in
        charity with his neighbor, to them is given the office of administering
        the Blood, and of governing souls. 
         "Wherefore if they do this solicitously and with love of virtue
        they receive, as has been said, more than others. Oh! how happy are
        their souls when they come to the extremity of death! For they have been
        the defenders and preachers of the faith to their neighbor. This faith
        they have incarnated in their very marrow, and with it they see their
        place of repose in Me. The hope with which they have lived, confiding in
        My providence and losing all trust in themselves, in that they did not
        hope in their own knowledge, and having lost hope in themselves, placed
        no inordinate love in any fellow-creature or in any created thing;
        having lived in voluntary poverty, causes them now with great delight to
        lift their confidence towards Me. Their heart, which was a vessel of
        love, inscribed by their ardent charity with My name, they showed forth
        with the example of their good and holy life and by the doctrine of
        their words to their neighbor. This heart then arises and seizes Me, who
        am its End, with ineffable love, restoring to Me the pearl of justice
        which it always carried before it, doing justice to all, and discreetly
        rendering to each his due. Wherefore this man renders to Me justice with
        true humility, and renders glory and praise to My Name, because he
        refers to Me the grace of having been able to run his course with a pure
        and holy conscience, and with himself he is indignant, deeming himself
        unworthy of receiving such grace. 
         "His conscience gives good testimony of him to Me, and I justly
        give him the crown of justice, adorned with the pearls of the virtues --
        that is, of the fruit which love has drawn from the virtues. Oh, earthly
        angel! happy you are in that you have not been ungrateful for the
        benefits received from Me, and have not been negligent or ignorant, but
        have solicitously opened your eye by the true light, and kept it on your
        subjects, and have faithfully and manfully followed the doctrine of the
        Good Shepherd, sweet Christ Jesus, My only-begotten Son, wherefore you
        are really now passing through Him, the Door, bathed and drowned in His
        blood, with your troop of lambs of whom you have brought many by your
        holy doctrine and example to eternal life, and have left many behind you
        in a state of grace. 
         "Oh, dearest daughter! to such as these the vision of the devils
        can do no harm, because of the vision which they have of Me, which they
        see by faith and hold by love; the darkness and the terrible aspect of
        the demons do not give them trouble or any fear, because in them is not
        the poison of sin. There is no servile fear in them, but holy fear.
        Wherefore they do not fear the demon's deception, because with
        supernatural light and with the light of Holy Scripture they know them,
        so that they do not cause them darkness or disquietude. So thus they
        gloriously pass, bathed in the blood, with hunger for the salvation of
        souls, all on fire with love for the neighbor, having passed through the
        door of the word and entered into Me; and by My goodness each one is
        arranged in his place, and to each one is measured of the affection of
        love according as he has measured to Me." 
          
         Of the death of sinners, and of their pains in the hour of death. 
          
         "Not so excellent, dearest daughter, is the end of these other
        poor wretches who are in great misery as I have related to you. How
        terrible and dark is their death! Because in the moment of death, as I
        told you, the Devil accuses them with great terror and darkness, showing
        his face, which you know is so horrible that the creature would rather
        choose any pain that can be suffered in this world than see it; and so
        greatly does he freshen the sting of conscience that it gnaws him
        horribly. The disordinate delights and sensuality of which he made lords
        over his reason, accuse him miserably, because then he knows the truth
        of that which at first he knew not, and his error brings him to great
        confusion. 
         "In his life he lived unfaithfully to Me -- self-love having
        veiled the pupil of the most holy faith -- wherefore the Devil torments
        him with infidelity in order to bring him to despair. Oh! how hard for
        them is this battle, because it finds them disarmed, without the armor
        of affection and charity; because, as members of the Devil, they have
        been deprived of it all. Wherefore they have not the supernatural light,
        neither the light of science, because they did not understand it, the
        horns of their pride not letting them understand the sweetness of its
        marrow. Wherefore now in the great battle they know not what to do. They
        are not nourished in hope, because they have not hoped in Me, neither in
        the Blood of which I made them ministers, but in themselves alone, and
        in the dignities and delights of the world. And the incarnate wretch did
        not see that all was counted to him with interest, and that as a debtor
        he would have to render an account to Me; now he finds himself denuded
        and without any virtue, and on whichever side he turns he hears nothing
        but reproaches with great confusion. His injustice which he practiced in
        his life accuses him to his conscience, wherefore he dares not ask other
        than justice. "And I tell you that so great is that shame and
        confusion that unless in their life they have taken the habit of hoping
        in My mercy, that is, have taken the milk of mercy (although on account
        of their sins this is great presumption, for you cannot truly say that
        he who strikes Me with the arm of My mercy has a hope in mercy, but
        rather has presumption), there is not one who would not despair, and
        with despair they would arrive with the Devil in eternal damnation. 
         "But arriving at the extremity of death, and recognizing his
        sin, his conscience unloaded by holy confession, and presumption taken
        away, so that he offends no more, there remains mercy, and with this
        mercy he can, if he will, take hold on hope. This is the effect of
        Mercy, to cause them to hope therein during their life, although I do
        not grant them this, so that they should offend Me by means of My mercy,
        but rather that they should dilate themselves in charity, and in the
        consideration of My goodness. But they act in a contrary way, because
        they offend Me in the hope which they have in My mercy. And
        nevertheless, I keep them in this hope so that at the last moment they
        may have something which they may lay hold of, and by so doing not faint
        away with the condemnation which they receive, and thus arrive at
        despair; for this final sin of despair is much more displeasing to Me
        and injures them much more than all the other sins which they have
        committed. And this is the reason why this sin is more dangerous to them
        and displeasing to Me, because they commit other sins through some
        delight of their own sensuality, and they sometimes grieve for them, and
        if they grieve in the right way their grief will procure them mercy. But
        it is no fragility of your nature which moves you to despair, for there
        is no pleasure and nothing but intolerable suffering in it. One who
        despairs despises My mercy, making his sin to be greater than mercy and
        goodness. Wherefore, if a man fall into this sin, he does not repent,
        and does not truly grieve for his offense against Me as he should,
        grieving indeed for his own loss, but not for the offense done to Me,
        and therefore he receives eternal damnation. See, therefore, that this
        sin alone leads him to hell, where he is punished for this and all the
        other sins which he has committed; whereas had he grieved and repented
        for the offense done to Me, and hoped in My mercy, he would have found
        mercy, for, as I have said to you, My mercy is greater without any
        comparison than all the sins which any creature can commit; wherefore it
        greatly displeases Me that they should consider their sins to be
        greater. 
         "Despair is that sin which is pardoned neither here nor
        hereafter, and it is because despair displeases Me so much that I wish
        them to hope in My mercy at the point of death, even if their life have
        been disordered and wicked. This is why during their life I use this
        sweet trick with them, making them hope greatly in My mercy, for when,
        having fed themselves with this hope, they arrive at death, they are not
        so inclined to abandon it, on account of the severe condemnation they
        receive, as if they had not so nourished themselves. 
         "All this is given them by the fire and abyss of My inestimable
        love, but because they have used it in the darkness of self-love, from
        which has proceeded their every sin, they have not known it in truth,
        but in so far as they have turned their affections towards the sweetness
        of My mercy they have thought of it with great presumption. And this is
        another cause of reproof which their conscience gives them in the
        likeness of the Devil, reproving them in that they should have used the
        time and the breadth of My mercy in which they hoped, in charity and
        love of virtue, and that time which I gave them through love should have
        been spent in holiness, whereas with all their time and great hope of My
        mercy they did nothing but offend Me miserably. Oh! blinder than the
        blind! You have hidden your pearl and your talent which I placed in your
        hands in order that you might gain more with it, but you in your
        presumption would not do My will, rather you hid it under the ground of
        disordinate self-love, which now renders you the fruit of death. 
         "Your miseries are not hid from you now, for the worm of
        conscience sleeps no longer, but is gnawing you, the devils shout and
        render to you the reward which they are accustomed to give their
        servants, that is to say, confusion and condemnation; they wish to bring
        you to despair, so that at the moment of death you may not escape from
        their hands, and therefore they try to confuse you, so that afterwards
        when you are with them they may render to you of the part which is
        theirs. Oh, wretch! the dignity in which I placed you, you now see
        shining as it really is, and you know to your shame that you have held
        and used in such guilty darkness the substance of the holy Church, that
        you see yourself to be a thief, a debtor, who ought to pay his debt to
        the poor and the holy Church. Then your conscience represents to you
        that you have spent the money on public harlots, and have brought up
        your children and enriched your relations, and have thrown it away on
        gluttony and on many silver vessels and other adornments for your house.
        Whereas you should have lived in voluntary poverty. 
         "Your conscience represents to you the divine office which you
        neglected, by which you fell into the guilt of mortal sin, and how even
        when you recited it with your mouth your heart was far from Me.
        Conscience also shows you your subjects, that is to say, the love and
        hunger which you should have felt towards nourishing them in virtue,
        giving them the example of your life and striking them with the hand of
        mercy and the rod of justice, and because you did the contrary your
        conscience and the horrible likeness of the Devil reproves you. 
         "And if as a prelate you have given prelacies or any charge of
        souls unjustly to one of your subjects, that is, that you have not
        considered to whom and how you were giving it, the Devil puts this also
        before your conscience, because you ought to have given it, not on
        account of pleasant words, nor in order to please creatures, nor for the
        sake of gifts, but solely with regard to virtue, My honor and the
        salvation of souls. And since you have not done so you are reproved, and
        for your greater pain and confusion you have before your conscience and
        the light of your intellect that which you have done and ought not to
        have done, and that which you ought to have done and have not done. 
         "I wish you to know, dearest daughter, that whiteness is better
        seen when placed on a black ground, and blackness on a white, than when
        they are separated. So it happens to these wretches, to these in
        particular and to all others in general, for at death when the soul
        begins to see its woes, and the just man his beatitude, his evil life is
        represented to a wicked man, and there is no reason that any one should
        remind him of the sins that he has committed, for his conscience places
        them before him, together with the virtues which he ought to have
        practiced. Why the virtues? For his greater shame. For vice being placed
        on a ground of virtue is known better on account of the virtue, and the
        better he knows his sin, the greater his shame, and by comparison with
        his sin he knows better the perfection of virtue, wherefore he grieves
        the more, for he sees that his own life was devoid of any; and I wish
        you to know that in this knowledge which dying sinners have of virtue
        and vice they see only too clearly the good which follows the virtue of
        a just man, and the pain that comes on him who has lain in the darkness
        of mortal sin. I do not give him this knowledge so that he may despair,
        but so that he may come to a perfect self-knowledge and shame for his
        sins, with hope, so that with that pain and knowledge he may pay for his
        sins, and appease My anger, humbly begging My mercy. The virtuous woman
        increases thereby in joy and in knowledge of My love, for he attributes
        the grace of having followed virtue in the doctrine of My truth to Me
        and not to himself, wherefore he exalts in Me, with this truly
        illuminated knowledge, and tastes and receives the sweet end of his
        being in the way which I have related to you in another place. So that
        the one, that is to say, the just man, who has lived in ardent charity,
        exults in joy, while the wicked man is darkened and confounded in
        sorrow. 
         "To the just man the appearance and vision of the Devil causes
        no harm or fear, for fear and harm can only be caused to him by sin; but
        those who have passed their lives lasciviously and in many sins, receive
        both harm and fear from the appearance of the devils, not indeed the
        harm of despair if they do not wish it, but the suffering of
        condemnation, of the refreshing of the worm of conscience, and of fear
        and terror at their horrible aspect. See now, dearest daughter, how
        different are the sufferings and the battle of death to a just man and
        to a sinner, and how different is their end. 
         "I have shown to the eye of your intellect a very small part of
        what happens, and so small is what I have shown you with regard to what
        it really is, to the suffering, that is, of the one, and the happiness
        of the other, that it is but a trifle. See how great is the blindness of
        man, and in particular of these ministers, for the more they have
        received of Me, and the more they are enlightened by the Holy Scripture,
        the greater are their obligations and more intolerable confusion do they
        receive for not fulfilling them; the more they knew of Holy Scripture
        during their life, the better do they know at their death the great sins
        they have committed, and their torments are greater than those of
        others, just as good men are placed in a higher degree of excellence.
        Theirs is the fate of the false Christian, who is placed in Hell in
        greater torment than a pagan, because he had the light of faith and
        renounced it, while the pagan never had it. 
         "So these wretches will be punished more than other Christians
        for the same sin, on account of the ministry which I entrusted to them,
        appointing them to administer the sun of the holy Sacrament, and because
        they had the light of science, in order to discern the truth both for
        themselves and others had they wished to; wherefore they justly receive
        the greater pains. But the wretches do not know this, for did they
        consider their state at all, they would not come to such misery, but
        would be that which they ought to be and are not. For the whole world
        has thus become corrupt, they being much more guilty than seculars,
        according to their state; for with their stench they defile the face of
        their soul, and corrupt their subjects, and suck the blood from My
        spouse, that is, the holy Church, wherefore through these sins they make
        her grow pale, because they divert to themselves the love and charity
        which they should have to this divine spouse, and think of nothing but
        stripping her for their own advantage, seizing prelacies, and great
        properties, when they ought to be seeking souls. Wherefore through their
        evil life, seculars become irreverent and disobedient to the holy
        Church, not that they ought on that account to do so, or that their sins
        are excused through the sins of My ministers." 
          
         How this devout soul, praising and thanking GOD, made a prayer for
        the Holy Church. 
          
         Then this soul, as if inebriated, tormented, and on fire with love,
        her heart wounded with great bitterness, turned herself to the Supreme
        and Eternal Goodness, saying: "Oh! Eternal God! oh! Light above
        every other light, from whom issues all light! Oh! Fire above every
        fire, because You are the only Fire who burn without consuming, and
        consume all sin and self-love found in the soul, not afflicting her, but
        fattening her with insatiable love, and though the soul is filled she is
        not sated, but ever desires You, and the more of You she has, the more
        she seeks -- and the more she desires, the more she finds and tastes of
        You -- Supreme and Eternal Fire, Abyss of Charity. Oh! Supreme and
        Eternal Good, who has moved You, Infinite God, to illuminate me, Your
        finite creature, with the light of Your Truth? You, the same Fire of
        Love are the cause, because it is always love which constrained and
        constrains You to create us in Your image and similitude, and to do us
        mercy, giving immeasurable and infinite graces to Your rational
        creatures. Oh! Goodness above all goodness! You alone are He who is
        Supremely Good, and nevertheless You gave the Word, Your only-begotten
        Son, to converse with us filthy ones and filled with darkness. What was
        the cause of this? Love. Because You loved us before we were. Oh! Good!
        oh! Eternal Greatness! You made Yourself low and small to make man
        great. On whichever side I turn I find nothing but the abyss and fire of
        Your charity. And can a wretch like me pay back to You the graces and
        the burning charity that You have shown and show with so much burning
        love in particular to me beyond common charity, and the love that You
        show to all Your creatures? No, but You alone, most sweet and amorous
        Father, are He who will be thankful and grateful for me, that is, that
        the affection of Your charity itself will render You thanks, because I
        am she who is not, and if I spoke as being anything of myself, I should
        be lying by my own head, and should be a lying daughter of the Devil,
        who is the father of lies, because You alone are He who is. And my being
        and every further grace that You have bestowed upon me, I have from You,
        who give them to me through love, and not as my due. 
         "Oh! sweetest Father, when the human race lay sick through the
        sin of Adam, You sent it a Physician, the sweet and amorous Word -- Your
        Son; and now, when I was lying infirm with the sickness of negligence
        and much ignorance, You, most soothing and sweet Physician, Eternal God,
        have given a soothing, sweet, and bitter medicine, that I may be cured
        and rise from my infirmity. You have soothed me because with Your love
        and gentleness You have manifested Yourself to me, Sweet above all
        sweetness, and have illuminated the eye of my intellect with the light
        of most holy faith, with which light, according as it has pleased You to
        manifest it to me, I have known the excellence of grace which You have
        given to the human race, administering to it the entire God- Man in the
        mystic body of the holy Church. And I have known the dignity of Your
        ministers whom You have appointed to administer You to us. I desired
        that You would fulfill the promise that You made to me, and You gave
        much more, more even than I knew how to ask for. Wherefore I know in
        truth that the heart of man knows not how to ask or desire as much as
        You can give, and thus I see that You are He who is the Supreme and
        Eternal Good, and that we are they who are not. And because You are
        infinite, and we are finite, You give that which Your rational creature
        cannot desire enough; for she cannot desire it in itself, nor in the way
        in which You can and will satisfy the soul, filling her with things for
        which she does not ask You. Moreover, I have received light from Your
        Greatness and Charity, through the love which You have for the whole
        human race, and in particular for Your anointed ones, who ought to be
        earthly angels in this life. You have shown me the virtue and beatitude
        of these Your anointed ones who have lived like burning lamps, shining
        with the Pearl of Justice in the holy Church. And by comparison with
        these I have better understood the sins of those who live wretchedly.
        Wherefore I have conceived a very great sorrow at Your offense and the
        harm done to the whole world, for they do harm to the world, being
        mirrors of sin when they ought to be mirrors of virtue. And because You
        have manifested and grieved over their iniquities to me -- a wretch who
        am the cause and instrument of many sins -- I am plunged in intolerable
        grief. 
         "You, oh! inestimable love, have manifested this to me, giving
        me a sweet and bitter medicine that I might wholly arise out of the
        infirmity of my ignorance and negligence, and have recourse to You with
        anxious and solicitous desire, knowing myself and Your goodness and the
        offenses which are committed against You by all sorts of people, so that
        I might shed a river of tears, drawn from the knowledge of Your infinite
        goodness, over my wretched self and over those who are dead in that they
        live miserably. Wherefore I do not wish, oh! Eternal Father, ineffable
        Fire of Love, that my heart should ever grow weary, or my eyes fail
        through tears, in desiring Your honor and the salvation of souls, but I
        beg of You, by Your grace, that they may be as two streams of water
        issuing from You, the Sea Pacific. Thanks, thanks to You, oh! Father,
        for having granted me that which I asked You and that which I neither
        knew nor asked, for by thus giving me matter for grief You have invited
        me to offer before You sweet, loving, and yearning desires, with humble
        and continual prayer. Now I beg of You that You will do mercy to the
        world and to the holy Church. I pray You to fulfill that which You
        caused me to ask You. Alas! what a wretched and sorrowful soul is mine,
        the cause of all these evils. Do not put off any longer Your merciful
        designs towards the world, but descend and fulfill the desire of Your
        servants. 
         "Ah me! You cause them to cry in order to hear their voices!
        Your truth told us to cry out, and we should be answered; to knock, and
        it would be opened to us; to beg, and it would be given to us. Oh!
        Eternal Father, Your servants do cry out to Your mercy; do You then
        reply. 
         "I know well that mercy is Your own attribute, wherefore You can
        not destroy it or refuse it to him who asks for it. Your servants knock
        at the door of Your truth, because in the truth of Your only-begotten
        Son they know the ineffable love which You have for man, wherefore the
        fire of Your love ought not and cannot refrain from opening to him who
        knocks with perseverance. Wherefore open, unlock, and break the hardened
        hearts of Your creatures, not for their sakes who do not knock, but on
        account of Your infinite goodness, and through love of Your servants who
        knock at You for their sakes. Grant the prayer of those, Eternal Father
        who, as You see, stand at the door of Your truth and pray. For what do
        they pray? For with the Blood of this door -- Your truth -- have You
        washed our iniquities and destroyed the stain of Adam's sin. The Blood
        is ours, for You have made it our bath, wherefore You can not deny it to
        any one who truly asks for it. Give, then, the fruit of Your Blood to
        Your creatures. Place in the balance the price of the blood of Your Son,
        so that the infernal devils may not carry off Your lambs. You are the
        Good Shepherd who, to fulfill Your obedience, laid down His life for
        Your lambs, and made for us a bath of His Blood. 
         "That Blood is what Your hungry servants beg of You at this
        door, begging You through it to do mercy to the world, and to cause Your
        holy Church to bloom with the fragrant flowers of good and holy pastors,
        who by their sweet odor shall extinguish the stench of the putrid
        flowers of sin. You have said, Eternal Father, that through the love
        which You have for Your rational creatures, and the prayers and the many
        virtues and labors of Your servants, You would do mercy to the world,
        and reform the Church, and thus give us refreshment; wherefore do not
        delay, but turn the eye of Your mercy towards us, for You must first
        reply to us before we can cry out with the voice of Your mercy. Open the
        door of Your inestimable love which You have given us through the door
        of Your Word. I know indeed that You open before even we can knock, for
        it is with the affection of love which You have given to Your servants,
        that they knock and cry to You, seeking Your honor and the salvation of
        souls. Give them then the bread of life, that is to say, the fruit of
        the Blood of Your only-begotten Son, which they ask of You for the
        praise and glory of My name and the salvation of souls. For more glory
        and praise will be Yours in saving so many creatures, than in leaving
        them obstinate in their hardness of heart. To You, Eternal Father,
        everything is possible, and even though You have created us without our
        own help, You will not save us without it. I beg of You to force their
        wills, and dispose them to wish for that for which they do not wish; and
        this I ask You through Your infinite mercy. You have created us from
        nothing; now, therefore, that we are in existence, do mercy to us, and
        remake the vessels which You have created to Your image and likeness.
        Re-create them to Grace in Your mercy and the Blood of Your Son sweet
        Christ Jesus." 
         
         A TREATISE OF OBEDIENCE 
         
         Here begins the treatise of obedience, and first of where obedience
        may be found, and what it is that destroys it, and what is the sign of a
        man's possessing it, and what accompanies and nourishes obedience. 
          
         The Supreme and Eternal Father, kindly turning the eye of His mercy
        and clemency towards her, replied: "Your holy desire and righteous
        request, oh! dearest daughter, have a right to be heard, and inasmuch as
        I am the Supreme Truth, I will keep My word, fulfilling the promise
        which I made to you, and satisfying your desire. And if you ask Me where
        obedience is to be found, and what is the cause of its loss, and the
        sign of its possession, I reply that you will find it in its
        completeness in the sweet and amorous Word, My only-begotten Son. So
        prompt in Him was this virtue, that, in order to fulfill it, He hastened
        to the shameful death of the Cross. What destroys obedience? Look at the
        first man and you will see the cause which destroyed the obedience
        imposed on him by Me, the Eternal Father. It was pride, which was
        produced by self- love, and desire to please his companion. This was the
        cause that deprived him of the perfection of obedience, giving him
        instead disobedience, depriving him of the life of grace, and slaying
        his innocence, wherefore he fell into impurity and great misery, and not
        only he, but the whole human race, as I said to you. The sign that you
        have this virtue is patience, and impatience the sign that you have it
        not, and you will find that this is indeed so, when I speak to you
        further concerning this virtue. But observe that obedience may be kept
        in two ways, of which one is more perfect than the other, not that they
        are on that account separated, but united as I explained to you of the
        precepts and counsels. The one way is the most perfect, the other is
        also good and perfect; for no one at all can reach eternal life if he be
        not obedient, for the door was unlocked by the key of obedience, which
        had been fastened by the disobedience of Adam. I, then, being
        constrained by My infinite goodness, since I saw that man whom I so much
        loved, did not return to Me, his End, took the keys of obedience and
        placed them in the hands of My sweet and amorous Word -- the Truth --
        and He becoming the porter of that door, opened it, and no one can enter
        except by means of that door and that Porter. Wherefore He said in the
        Holy Gospel that 'no one could come to Me, the Father, if not by Him.'
        When He returned to Me, rising to Heaven from the conversation of men at
        the Ascension, He left you this sweet key of obedience; for as you know
        He left His vicar, the Christ, on earth, whom you are all obliged to
        obey until death, and whoever is outside His obedience is in a state of
        damnation, as I have already told you in another place. Now I wish you
        to see and know this most excellent virtue in that humble and immaculate
        Lamb, and the source whence it proceeds. What caused the great obedience
        of the Word? The love which He had for My honor and your salvation.
        Whence proceeded this love? From the clear vision with which His soul
        saw the divine essence and the eternal Trinity, thus always looking on
        Me, the eternal God. His fidelity obtained this vision most perfectly
        for Him, which vision you imperfectly enjoy by the light of holy faith.
        He was faithful to Me, His eternal Father, and therefore hastened as one
        enamored along the road of obedience, lit up with the light of glory.
        And inasmuch as love cannot be alone, but is accompanied by all the true
        and royal virtues, because all the virtues draw their life from love, He
        possessed them all, but in a different way from that in which you do.
        Among the others he possessed patience, which is the marrow of
        obedience, and a demonstrative sign, whether a soul be in a state of
        grace and truly love or not. Wherefore charity, the mother of patience,
        has given her as a sister to obedience, and so closely united them
        together that one cannot be lost without the other. Either you have them
        both or you have neither. This virtue has a nurse who feeds her, that
        is, true humility; therefore a soul is obedient in proportion to her
        humility, and humble in proportion to her obedience. This humility is
        the foster-mother and nurse of charity, and with the same milk she feeds
        the virtue of obedience. Her raiment given her by this nurse is
        self-contempt, and insult, desire to displease herself, and to please
        Me. Where does she find this? In sweet Christ Jesus, My only-begotten
        Son. For who abased Himself more than He did! He was sated with insults,
        jibes, and mockings. He caused pain to Himself in His bodily life, in
        order to please Me. And who was more patient than He? for His cry was
        never heard in murmuring, but He patiently embraced His injuries like
        one enamored, fulfilling the obedience imposed on Him by Me, His Eternal
        Father. Wherefore in Him you will find obedience perfectly accomplished.
        He left you this rule and this doctrine, which gives you life, for it is
        the straight way, having first observed them Himself. He is the way,
        wherefore He said, 'He was the Way, the Truth, and the Life.' For he who
        travels by that way, travels in the light, and being enlightened cannot
        stumble, or be caused to fall, without perceiving it. For He has cast
        from Himself the darkness of self-love, by which he fell into
        disobedience; for as I spoke to you of a companion virtue proceeding
        from obedience and humility, so I tell you that disobedience comes from
        pride, which issues from self-love depriving the soul of humility. The
        sister given by self-love to disobedience is impatience, and pride, her
        foster-mother, feeds her with the darkness of infidelity, so she hastens
        along the way of darkness, which leads her to eternal death. All this
        you should read in that glorious book, where you find described this and
        every other virtue." 
          
         How obedience is the key with which Heaven is opened, and how the
        soul should fasten it by means of a cord to her girdle, and of the
        excellences of obedience. 
          
         "Now that I have shown you where obedience is to be found, and
        whence she comes, and who is her companion, and who her foster-mother, I
        will continue to speak of the obedient and of the disobedient together,
        and of obedience in general, which is the obedience of the precepts; and
        in particular, which is that of the counsels. The whole of your faith is
        founded upon obedience, for by it you prove your fidelity. You are all
        in general by My truth to obey the commandments of the law, the chief of
        which is to love Me above everything, and your neighbor as yourself, and
        the commandments are so bound up together, that you cannot observe or
        transgress one without observing or transgressing all. He who observes
        this principal commandment observes all the others; he is faithful to Me
        and his neighbor, for he loves Me and My creature, and is therefore
        obedient, becoming subject to the commandments of the law, and to
        creatures for My sake, and with humble patience he endures every labor,
        and even his neighbor's detraction of him. This obedience is of such
        excellence that you all derive grace from it, just as from disobedience
        you all derive death. Wherefore it is not enough that it should be only
        in word, and not practiced by you. I have already told you that this
        word is the key which opens heaven, which key My Son placed in the hands
        of His vicar. This vicar placed it in the hands of everyone who receives
        holy baptism, promising therein to renounce the world and all its pomps
        and delights, and to obey. So that each man has in his own person that
        very same key which the Word had, and if a man does not unlock in the
        light of faith, and with the hand of love the gate of heaven by means of
        this key, he never will enter there, in spite of its having been opened
        by the Word; for though I created you without yourselves, I will not
        save you without yourselves. Wherefore you must take the key in your
        hand and walk by the doctrine of My Word, and not remain seated, that is
        to say, placing your love in finite things, as do foolish men who follow
        the first man, their first father, following his example, and casting
        the key of obedience into the mud of impurity, breaking it with the
        hammer of pride, rusting it with self-love. It would have been entirely
        destroyed had not My only-begotten Son, the Word, come and taken this
        key of obedience in His hands and purified it in the fire of divine
        love, having drawn it out of the mud, and cleansed it with His blood,
        and straightened it with the knife of justice, and hammered your
        iniquities into shape on the anvil of His own body. So perfectly did He
        repair it that no matter how much a man may have spoiled his key by his
        free-will, by the self- same free-will, assisted by My grace, he can
        repair it with the same instruments that were used by My Word. Oh!
        blinder than the blind, for, having spoiled the key of obedience, you do
        not think of mending it! Do you think, forsooth, that the disobedience
        which closed the door of Heaven will open it? that the pride which fell
        can rise? Do you think to be admitted to the marriage feast in foul and
        disordered garments? Do you think that sitting down and binding yourself
        with the chain of mortal sin, you can walk? or that without a key you
        can open the door? Do not imagine that you can, for it is a fantastical
        delusion; you must be firm, you must leave mortal sin by a holy
        confession, contrition of heart, satisfaction, and purpose of amendment.
        Then you will throw off that hideous and defiled garment and, clothed in
        the shining nuptial robe, will hasten, the key of obedience in your
        hand, to open the door. But bind this key with the cord of
        self-contempt, and hatred of yourself and of the world, and fasten it to
        the love of pleasing Me, Your creator, of which you should make a girdle
        to yourself to bind your loins with it, for fear you lose it. Know, My
        daughter, there are many who take up this key of obedience, having seen
        by the light of faith that in no other way can they escape eternal
        damnation; but they hold it in their hand without wearing this girdle,
        or fastening the key to it with the cord of self-contempt, that is to
        say that they are not perfectly clothed with My pleasure, but still seek
        to please themselves; they do not wear the cord of self-contempt, for
        they do not desire to be despised, but rather take delight in the praise
        of men. Such as these are apt to lose their key; for if they suffer a
        little extra fatigue, or mental or corporal tribulation, and if, as
        often happens, the hand of holy desire loosens its grasp, they will lose
        it. They can indeed find it again if they wish to while they live, but
        if they do not wish they will never find it, and what will prove to
        them, that they have lost it? Impatience, for patience was united to
        obedience, and their impatience proves that obedience does not dwell in
        their soul. Oh! how sweet and glorious is this virtue, which contains
        all the rest, for she is conceived and born of charity, on her is
        founded the rock of the holy faith. She is a queen whose consort will
        feel no trouble, but only peace and quiet; the waves of the stormy sea
        cannot hurt her, nor can any tempest reach the interior of the soul in
        whom she dwells. Such a one feels no hatred when injured, because he
        wishes to obey the precept of forgiveness, he suffers not when his
        appetites are not satisfied, because obedience has ordered him to desire
        Me alone, who can and will satisfy all his desires, if he strip himself
        of worldly riches. And so in all things which would be too long to
        relate, he who has chosen as spouse Queen Obedience, the appointed key
        of heaven, finds peace and quiet. Oh! blessed obedience! you voyage
        without fatigue, and reach without danger the port of salvation, you are
        conformed to My only-begotten Son, the Word, you board the ship of the
        holy cross, forcing yourself to endure, so as not to transgress the
        obedience of the Word, nor abandon His doctrine, of which you make a
        table when you eat the food of souls, dwelling in the love of your
        neighbor, being anointed with true humility, which saves you from
        coveting, contrary to My will, his possessions, you walk erect, without
        bending, for your heart is sincere and not false, loving generously and
        truly My creatures, you are a sunrise drawing after you the light of
        divine grace, you are a sun which makes the earth, that is to say, the
        organs of the soul, to germinate with the heat of charity, all of which
        as well as those of the body produce life-giving fruit for yourself and
        your neighbor. You are even cheerful, for your face is never wrinkled
        with impatience, but smooth and pleasant with the happiness of patience,
        and even in its fortitude you are great by your long endurance, so long
        that it reaches from earth to heaven and unlocks the celestial door. You
        are a hidden pearl, trampled by the world, abasing yourself, submitting
        to all creatures. Yet your kingdom is so great that no one can rule you,
        for you have come out of the mortal servitude of your own sensuality,
        which destroyed your dignity, and having slain this enemy with hatred
        and dislike of your own pleasure have re-obtained your liberty." 
         
         Here both the misery of the disobedient and the excellence of the
        obedient are spoken of. 
         
         "All this, dearest daughter, has been done by My goodness and
        providence as I have told you, for by My providence the Word repaired
        the key of obedience, but worldly men devoid of every virtue do the
        contrary; they, like unbridled horses, without the bit of obedience, go
        from bad to worse, from sin to sin, from misery to misery, from darkness
        to darkness, from death to death, until they finally reach the edge of
        the ditch of death, gnawed by the worm of their conscience, and though
        it is true that they can obey the precepts of the law if they will, and
        have the time repenting of their disobedience, it is very hard for them
        to do so, on account of their long habit of sin. Therefore let no man
        trust to this, putting off his finding of the key of obedience to the
        moment of his death, for although everyone may and should hope as long
        as he has life, he should not put such trust in this hope as to delay
        repentance. What is the reason of all this, and of such blindness that
        prevents them recognizing this treasure? The cloud of self-love and
        wretched pride, through which they abandoned obedience, and fell into
        disobedience. Being disobedient they are impatient, as has been said,
        and in their impatience endure intolerable pain, for it has seduced them
        from the way of Truth, leading them along a way of lies, making them
        slaves and friends of the devils with whom, unless indeed they amend
        themselves with patience, they will go to the eternal torments.
        Contrariwise, My beloved sons, obedient and observers of the law,
        rejoice and exult in My eternal vision with the Immaculate and humble
        Lamb, the Maker, Fulfiller, and Giver of this law of obedience.
        Observing this law in this life they taste peace without any
        disturbance, they receive and clothe themselves in the most perfect
        peace, for there they possess every good without any evil, safety
        without any fear, riches without any poverty, satiety without disgust,
        hunger without pain, light without darkness, one supreme infinite good,
        shared by all those who taste it truly. What has placed them in so
        blessed a state? The blood of the Lamb, by virtue of which the key of
        obedience has lost its rust, so that, by the virtue of the blood, it has
        been able to unlock the door. Oh! fools and madmen, delay no longer to
        come out of the mud of impurity, for you seem like pigs to wallow in the
        mire of your own lust. Abandon the injustice, murders, hatreds, rancors,
        detractions, murmurings, false judgments, and cruelty, with which you
        use your neighbors, your thefts and treacheries, and the disordinate
        pleasures and delights of the world; cut off the horns of pride, by
        which amputation you will extinguish the hatred which is in your heart
        against your neighbors. Compare the injuries which you do to Me and to
        your neighbor with those done to you, and you will see that those done
        to you are but trifles. You will see that remaining in hatred you injure
        Me by transgressing My precept, and you also injure the object of your
        hate, for you deprive him of your love, whereas you have been commanded
        to love Me above everything, and your neighbor as yourself. No gloss has
        been put upon these words as if it should have been said, if your
        neighbor injures you do not love him; but they are to be taken naturally
        and simply, as they were said to you by My Truth, who Himself literally
        observed this rule. Literally also should you observe it, and if you do
        not you will injure your own soul, depriving it of the life of grace.
        Take, oh! take, then, the key of obedience with the light of faith, walk
        no longer in such darkness or cold, but observe obedience in the fire of
        love, so that you may taste eternal life together with the other
        observers of the law." 
          
         Of those who have such love for obedience that they do not remain
        content with the general obedience of precepts, but take on themselves a
        particular obedience. 
          
         "There are some, My dearest daughter, in whom the sweet and
        amorous fire of love towards obedience burns so high (which fire of love
        cannot exist without hatred of self-love, so that when the fire
        increases so does this self-hatred), that they are not content to
        observe the precepts of the Law with a general obedience as you are all
        obliged to do if you will have life and not death, but take upon
        themselves a particular obedience, following the greatest perfection, so
        that they become observers of the counsels both in deed and in thought.
        Such as these wish to bind themselves more tightly through self-hatred,
        and in order to restrain in everything their own will. They either place
        themselves under the yoke of obedience in holy religion, or, without
        entering religion, they bind themselves to some creature, submitting
        their will to his, so as more expeditiously to unlock the door of
        Heaven. These are they, as I have told you, who have chosen the most
        perfect obedience. I have already spoken to you of obedience in general,
        and as I know it to be your will that I should speak to you of this
        particular and most perfect obedience, I will now relate to you somewhat
        of this second kind, which is not divided from the first, but is more
        perfect, for, as I have already told you, these two kinds of obedience
        are so closely united together that they cannot be separated. I have
        told you where general obedience is to be found and whence it proceeds,
        and the cause of its loss. Now I will speak to you of this particular
        obedience, not altering, however, the fundamental principle of the
        virtue." 
          
         How a soul advances from general to particular obedience; and of the
        excellence of the religious orders. 
          
         "The soul who with love has submitted to the yoke of obedience,
        to the Commandments, following the doctrine of My truth virtuously
        exercising herself, as has been said, in this general kind of obedience
        will advance to the second kind by means of the same light which brought
        her to the first, for by the light of the most holy faith she would have
        learnt, in the blood of the humble Lamb, My truth -- the ineffable love
        which I have for her, and her own fragility, which cannot respond to Me
        with due perfection. So she wanders, seeking by that light in what place
        and in what way she can pay her debt, trampling on her own fragility,
        and restraining her own will. Enlightened in her search by faith, she
        finds the place -- namely, holy religion -- which has been founded by
        the Holy Spirit, appointed as the ship to receive souls who wish to
        hasten to perfection, and to bring them to the port of salvation. The
        Captain of this ship is the Holy Spirit, who never fails in Himself
        through the defects of any of His religious subjects who may transgress
        the rule of the order. The ship itself cannot be damaged, but only the
        offender. It is true that the mistake of the steersman may send her down
        into the billows, and these are wicked pastors and prelates appointed by
        the Master of the ship. The ship herself is so delightful that your
        tongue could not narrate it. I say, then, that the soul, on fire with
        desire and a holy self-hatred, having found her place by the light of
        faith, enters there as one dead, if she is truly obedient; that is to
        say, if she have perfectly observed general obedience. And even if she
        should be imperfect when she enters, it does not follow that she cannot
        attain perfection. On the contrary, she attains it by exercising herself
        in the virtue of obedience; indeed, most of those who enter are
        imperfect. There are some who enter already in perfection, others in the
        childhood of virtue, others through fear, others through penance, others
        through allurements, everything depends on whether after they have
        entered they exercise themselves in virtue, and persevere till death,
        for no true judgment can be made on a person's entrance into religion,
        but only on their perseverance, for many have appeared to be perfect who
        have afterwards turned back, or remained in the order with much
        imperfection, so that, as I have said, the act of entrance into this
        ship ordained by Me, who call men in different ways, does not supply
        material for a real judgment, but only the love of those who persevere
        therein with true obedience. This ship is rich, so that there is no need
        for the subject to think about his necessities either temporal or
        spiritual, for if he is truly obedient, and observes his order, he will
        be provided for by his Master, who is the Holy Spirit, as I told you
        when I spoke to you of My providence, saying that though your servants
        might be poor, they were never beggars. No more are these, for they find
        everything they need, and those who observe this order find this to be
        indeed true. Wherefore, see that in the days when the religious orders
        lived virtuously, blossoming with true poverty and fraternal charity,
        their temporal substance never failed them, but they had more than their
        needs demanded. But because the stench of self-love has entered and
        caused each to keep his private possessions and to fail in obedience,
        their temporal substance has failed, and the more they possess to the
        greater destitution do they come. It is just that even in the smallest
        matters they should experience the fruit of disobedience, for had they
        been obedient and observed the vow of poverty, each would not have taken
        his own, and lived privately. See the riches of these holy rules, so
        thoughtfully and luminously appointed by those who were temples of the
        Holy Spirit. See with what judgment Benedict ordered his ship; see with
        what perfection and order of poverty Francis ordered his ship, decked
        with the pearls of virtue, steering it in the way of lofty perfection,
        being the first to give his order for spouse, true and holy poverty,
        whom he had chosen for himself, embracing self-contempt and self-hatred,
        not desiring to please any creature but only your will; desiring rather
        to be thought vile by the world, macerating his body and slaying his
        will, clothing himself in insults, sufferings, and jibes, for love of
        the humble Lamb, with whom he was fastened and nailed to the cross by
        love, so that by a singular grace there appeared in his body the very
        wounds of your Truth, showing in the vessel of his body that which was
        in the love of his soul, so he prepared the way. 
         "But you will say, 'Are not all the other religious orders
        equally founded on this point?' Yes, but though they are all founded on
        it, in no other is this the principal foundation; as with the virtues,
        though all the virtues draw their life from charily, nevertheless, as I
        explained to you in another place, one virtue belongs especially to one
        man, and another to another, and yet they all remain in charity, so with
        the principal foundation of the religious orders. Poverty belonged
        especially to My poor man Francis, who placed the principal foundation
        of his order in love for this poverty, and made it very strict for those
        who were perfect, for the few and the good, not for the majority. I say
        few because they are not many who choose this perfection, though now
        through their sins they are multiplied in numbers and deficient in
        virtue, not through defect of the ship, but through disobedient subjects
        and wicked rulers. Now look at the ship of your father Dominic, My
        beloved son: he ordered it most perfectly, wishing that his sons should
        apply themselves only to My honor and the salvation of souls, with the
        light of science, which light he laid as his principal foundation, not,
        however, on that account, being deprived of true and voluntary poverty,
        but having it also. And as a sign that he had it truly, and that the
        contrary displeased him, he left as an heirloom to his sons his curse
        and Mine, if they should hold any possessions, either privately or in
        community, as a sign that he had chosen for his spouse Queen Poverty.
        But for his more immediate and personal object he took the light of
        science in order to extirpate the errors which had arisen in his time,
        thus taking on him the office of My only-begotten Son, the Word. Rightly
        he appeared as an apostle in the world, and sowed the seed of My Word
        with much truth and light, dissipating darkness and giving light. He was
        a light which I gave the world by means of Mary, placed in the mystical
        body of the Holy Church as an extirpator of heresies. Why do I say by
        means of Mary? Because Mary gave him his habit -- this office was
        committed to her by My goodness. At what table does he feed his sons
        with the light of science? At the table of the cross, which is the table
        of holy desire, when souls are eaten for My honor. Dominic does not wish
        his sons to apply themselves to anything, but remaining at this table,
        there to seek with the light of science, the glory and praise of My name
        alone, and the salvation of souls. And in order that they might do
        nothing else, he chose poverty for them, so that they might not have the
        care of temporal things. It is true that some failed in faith, fearing
        that they would not be provided for, but he never. Being clothed in
        faith, and hoping with firm confidence in My providence, He wishes his
        sons to observe obedience and do their duty, and since impure living
        obscures the eye of the intellect, and not only the eye of the
        intellect, but also of the body, he does not wish them to obscure their
        physical light with which they may more perfectly obtain the light of
        science; wherefore he imposed on them the third vow of continence, and
        wishes that all should observe it, with true and perfect obedience,
        although today it is badly observed. They also prevent the light of
        science with the darkness of pride, not that this light can be darkened
        in itself, but only in their souls, for there, where pride is, can be no
        obedience. I have already told you that a man's humility is in
        proportion to his obedience, and his obedience to his humility, and
        similarly, when he transgresses the vow of obedience, it rarely happens
        that he does not also transgress the vow of continence, either in
        thought or deed; so that he has rigged his ship with the three ropes of
        obedience, continence, and true poverty; he made it a royal ship, not
        obliging his subjects under pain of mortal sin, and illuminated by Me
        the true light, he provided for those who should be less perfect, for
        though all who observe the order are perfect in kind, yet one possesses
        a higher degree of perfection than another, yet all perfect or imperfect
        live well in this ship. He allied himself with My truth, showing that he
        did not desire the death of a sinner, but rather that he should be
        converted and live. Wherefore his religion is a delightful garden, broad
        and joyous and flagrant, but the wretches who do not observe the order,
        but transgress its vows, have turned it into a desert and defiled it
        with their scanty virtue and light of science, though they are nourished
        at its breast. I do not say that the order itself is in this condition,
        for it still possesses every delight, but in the beginning its subjects
        were not as they are now, but blooming flowers, and men of great
        perfection. Each scented to be another St. Paul, their eyes so
        illuminated that the darkness of error was dissipated by their glance.
        Look at My glorious Thomas, who gazed with the gentle eye of his
        intellect at My Truth, whereby he acquired supernatural light and
        science infused by grace, for he obtained it rather by means of prayer
        than by human study. He was a brilliant light, illuminating his order
        and the mystical body of the Holy Church, dissipating the clouds of
        heresy. Look at My Peter, virgin and martyr, who by his blood gave light
        among the darkness of many heresies, and the heretics hated him so that
        at last they took his life; yet while he lived he applied himself to
        nothing but prayer, preaching, and disputation with heretics, hearing
        confessions, announcing the truth, and spreading the faith without any
        fear, to such an extent that he not only confessed it in his life but
        even at the moment of his death, for when he was at the last extremity,
        having neither voice nor ink left, having received his death-blow, he
        dipped his finger in his blood, and this glorious martyr, having not
        paper on which to write, leaned over, confessing the faith, and wrote
        the Credo on the ground. His heart burnt in the furnace of My charity,
        so that he never slackened his pace nor turned his head back, though he
        knew that he was to die, for I had revealed to him his death, but like a
        true knight he fearlessly came forth on to the battlefield; and I could
        tell you the same of many others, who though they did not actually
        experience martyrdom, were martyrs in will like Dominic; great laborers
        were these sent by My Father to labor in His vineyard to extirpate the
        thorns of vice, planting the virtues in their stead. Of a truth Dominic
        and Francis were two columns of the holy Church. Francis with the
        poverty which was specially his own, as has been said, and Dominic with
        his learning." 
          
         Of the excellence of the obedient, and of the misery of the
        disobedient members of the religious orders. 
          
         "Now that places suitable for obedience have been found, namely,
        these ships commanded by the Holy Spirit through the medium of their
        superiors, for, as I told you, the Holy Spirit is the true Master of
        these ships, which are built in the light of the most holy faith by
        those who have the light to know that My clemency, the Holy Spirit, will
        steer them, and having thus shown you the place of obedience and its
        perfection, I will speak to you of the obedience and of the disobedience
        of those who travel in such a ship, speaking of all together and not of
        one ship -- that is, one order -- in particular, showing you the sin of
        the disobedient and the virtue of the obedient, so that a man may better
        know the one by contrast with the other, and how he should walk if he
        would enter the ship of a religious order. How should he walk who wishes
        to enter this state of perfect and particular obedience? With the light
        of holy faith, by which he will know that he must slay his self-will
        with the knife of hatred of every sensual passion, taking the spouse
        which charity gives him, together with her sister. The spouse is true
        and prompt obedience, and the sister, patience; and he must also take
        the nurse of humility, for without this nurse obedience would perish of
        hunger, for obedience soon dies in a soul deprived of this little virtue
        of humility. 
         "Humility is not alone but has the handmaid of contempt of self
        and of the world, which causes the soul to hold herself vile, and not to
        desire honor but shame. Thus dead to himself, should he who is old
        enough enter the ship of a religious order, but however he may enter it
        (for I have told you that I call souls in diverse ways), he should
        acquire and preserve this affection, hurrying generously to seize the
        key of the obedience of his order, which will open the little door which
        is in the panel of the door of Heaven. Such as these have undertaken to
        open the little door, doing without the great key of general obedience,
        which opens the door of Heaven, as I have said to you. They have taken a
        little key, passing through a low and narrow opening in the great door.
        This small door is part of the great door, as you may see in any real
        door. They should keep this key when they have got it, and not throw it
        away. And because the truly obedient have seen with the light of faith
        that they will never be able to pass through this little door with the
        load of their riches and the weight of their own will without great
        fatigue and without losing their life, and that they cannot walk with
        head erect without breaking their neck; whether they wish to or not,
        they cast from them the load of their riches, and of their own will
        observing the vow of voluntary poverty, refusing to possess anything,
        for they see by the light of faith to what ruin they would come if they
        transgressed obedience, and the and of poverty which they promised to
        keep. The disobedient walk in pride, holding their heads erect, and if
        sometimes it suits their convenience to obey they do not incline their
        heads with humility, but proudly do so, because they must, which force
        breaks the neck of their will, for they fulfill their obedience with
        hatred of their order and of their superior. Little by little they are
        ruined on another point, for they transgress the vow of continence, for
        he who does not constrain his appetite or strip himself of temporal
        substance makes many relations and finds plenty of friends who love him
        for their own profit. From these relations they go on to close
        intimacies, their body they tend luxuriously, for being without either
        the nurse of humility or her sister, self-contempt, they live in their
        own pleasure richly and delicately, not like religious but like nobles,
        without watching or prayer. This and many other things happen to them
        because they have money to spend, for if they had it not they could not
        spend it. They fall into mental and physical impurity, for if sometimes
        from shame or through lack of means they abstain physically, they
        indulge themselves mentally, for it is impossible for a man with many
        worldly relations, of delicate habits and disordinate greediness, who
        watches not nor prays, to preserve his mind pure. Wherefore the
        perfectly obedient man sees from afar with the light of holy faith the
        evil and the loss which would come to him from temporal possessions and
        from walking weighed down by his own will; he also sees that he is
        obliged to pass by this narrow door, and that in such a state he would
        die before he would be able to pass it, having no key of obedience
        wherewith to open it, for as I said to you, he is obliged to pass
        through it. Wherefore it is that whether he will or no he should not
        leave the ship of the order, but should walk the narrow path of
        obedience to his superior. 
         "Wherefore the perfectly obedient man rises above himself and
        his own sensuality, and rising above his own feelings with living faith,
        places self-hatred as servant in the house of his soul to drive out the
        enemy of self-love, for he does not wish that his spouse, Obedience,
        given him with the light of faith by her mother, Charity, should be
        offended; so he drives out the enemy and puts in his place the nurse and
        companions of his spouse. "The love of obedience places in the
        house of his soul the lovers of his spouse, Obedience, who are the true
        and royal virtues, the customs and observances of his order, so that
        this sweet spouse enters his soul with her sister, Patience, and her
        nurse, Humility, together with Self-contempt and Self-hatred, and when
        she has entered she possesses peace and quiet, for her enemies have been
        exiled. She dwells in the garden of true continence, with the sun of
        intellectual light shining in, the eye of holy faith fixed on the object
        of My Truth, for her object is My Truth, and the fire of love with which
        she observes the rules of the order, warms all her servants and
        companions. 
         "Who are her enemies who have been expelled? The chief is
        self-love, producing pride, the enemy of humility and charity.
        Impatience is the enemy of patience, disobedience of true obedience,
        infidelity of faith, presumption and self-confidence do not accord with
        the true hope which the soul should have in Me; injustice cannot be
        conformed to justice, nor imprudence to prudence, nor intemperance to
        temperance, nor the transgression of the commandments of the order to
        perfect observance of them, nor the wicked conversation of those who
        live in sin to the good conversation of My servants. These are a man's
        enemies, causing him to leave the good customs and traditions of his
        order. He has also those other cruel enemies, anger, which wars against
        his benevolence; cruelty, against his kindness; wrath, against his
        benignity; hatred of virtue, against the love of virtue; impurity,
        against chastity; negligence, against solicitude; ignorance, against
        knowledge; and sloth against watchfulness and continued prayer. 
         "And since he knew by the light of faith that all these were his
        enemies who would defile his spouse, holy obedience, he appointed hatred
        to drive them out, and love to replace them with her friends. Wherefore
        with the knife of hatred he slew his perverse self-will, who, nourished
        by self-love, gave life to all these enemies of true obedience, and
        having cut off the source by which all the others are preserved in life,
        he remains free and in peace without any war, for there is no one to
        make war on him, for the soul has cut off from herself that which kept
        her in bitterness and in sadness. What makes war on obedience? Injuries?
        No, for the obedient man is patient, patience being the sister of
        obedience. The weight of the observances of the order? No, for obedience
        causes him to fulfill them. Does the weight of obedience give him pain?
        No, for he has trampled on his own will, and does not care to examine or
        judge the will of his superior, for with the light of faith he sees My
        will in him, believing truly that My clemency causes him to command
        according to the needs of his subject's salvation. Is he disgusted and
        angry at having to perform the humble duties of the order or to endure
        the mockeries, reproofs, jibes, and insults which are often cast at him,
        or to be held at little worth? No, for he has conceived love for self-
        contempt and self-hatred. Wherefore he rejoices with patience, exulting
        with delight and joy in the company of his spouse, true obedience, for
        the only thing which saddens him is to see Me, his Creator, offended.
        His conversation is with those who truly fear Me, and if he should
        converse with those who are separated from My Will, it is not in order
        to conform himself to their sins, but to draw them out of their misery,
        for through the brotherly love which he has in his heart towards them he
        would like to give them the good which he possesses, seeing that more
        glory and praise would be given to My name by many observing aright
        their order than by him doing so alone. Wherefore he endeavors to
        convert religious and seculars by his words and by prayer, and by every
        means by which he can draw them out of the darkness of mortal sin. Thus
        the conversations of a truly obedient man are good and perfect, whether
        they be with just men or with sinners, through his rightly ordered love
        and the breadth of his charity. Of his cell he makes a heaven,
        delighting there to converse with Me, his supreme and eternal Father,
        with the affection of love, flying idleness with humble and continual
        prayer, and when, through the illusion of the Devil, thoughts come
        crowding into his cell, he does not sit down on the bed of negligence
        embracing idleness, nor care to examine by reason the thoughts or
        opinions of his heart, but he flies sloth, rising above himself and his
        senses with hatred and true humility, patiently enduring the weariness
        which he feels in his mind, and resisting by watching and humble prayer,
        fixing the eye of his intellect on Me, and seeing with the light of
        faith that I am his helper, and both can and will help him, and open to
        him the eyes of My kindness, and that it is I who permit this suffering
        in order that he may be more eager to fly himself and come to Me. And if
        it should seem to him that on account of his great weariness and the
        darkness of his mind, mental prayer is impossible, he recites vocal
        prayers, or busies himself with some corporal exercises, so that by
        these means he may avoid idleness. He looks at Me with the light which I
        give him through love, which draws forth true humility, for he deems
        himself unworthy of the peace and quiet of mind of My other servants,
        but rather worthy of pain, for he despises himself in his own mind with
        hatred and self-reproach, thinking that he can never endure enough pain,
        for neither his hope nor My providence fail him, but with faith and the
        key of obedience he passes over this stormy sea in the ship of his
        order, dwelling thus in his cell as has been said, and avoiding
        idleness. 
         "The obedient man wishes to be the first to enter choir and the
        last to leave it, and when he sees a brother more obedient than himself
        he regards him in his eagerness with a holy envy, stealing from him the
        virtue in which he excels, not wishing, however, that his brother should
        have less thereof, for if he wished this he would be separated from
        brotherly love. The obedient man does not leave the refectory, but
        visits it continually and delights at being at table with the poor. And
        as a sign that he delights therein, and so as to have no reason to
        remain without, he has abandoned his temporal substance, observing so
        perfectly the vow of poverty that he blames himself for considering even
        the necessities of his body. His cell is full of the odor of poverty,
        and not of clothes; he has no fear that thieves will come to rob him, or
        that rust or moths will corrupt his garments; and if anything is given
        to him, he does not think of laying it by for his own use, but freely
        shares it with his brethren, not thinking of the morrow, but rather
        depriving himself today of what he needs, thinking only of the kingdom
        of heaven and how he may best observe true obedience. 
         "And in order that he may better keep to the path of humility,
        he submits to small and great, to poor and rich, and becomes the servant
        of all, never refusing labor, but serving all with charity. The obedient
        man does not wish to fulfill his obedience in his own way, or to choose
        his time or place, but prefers the way of his order and of his superior.
        All this the truly and perfectly obedient man does without pain and
        weariness of mind. He passes with this key in his hand through the
        narrow door of the order, easily and without violence, because he
        observes the vows of poverty, true obedience, and continence, having
        abandoned the heights of pride, and bowed his head to obedience through
        humility. He does not break his neck through impatience, but is patient
        with fortitude and enduring perseverance, the friends of obedience. Thus
        he passes by the assaults of the devils, mortifying and macerating his
        flesh, stripping it bare of all pleasures and delights and clothing it
        with the labors of the order in a faith which despises nothing, for as a
        child who does not remember the blows and injuries inflicted on him by
        his father, so this child of the spirit does not remember the injuries,
        pains, or blows inflicted on him by his superior in the order, but
        calling him humbly, turns to him without anger, hatred, or rancor, but
        with meekness and benevolence. 
         "These are those little ones of whom My Truth spoke to the
        disciples, who were contending among themselves which of them should be
        the greater, for calling a child, He said: 'Allow the little ones to
        come to Me, for of such is the kingdom of heaven to be; whoever will not
        humble himself like this child (that is, who will not keep this
        childlike condition), shall not enter the kingdom of heaven. For he who
        humbles himself, dearest daughter, will be exalted, and he who exalts
        himself will be humbled,' which also was said to you by My Truth.
        Justly, therefore, are these humble little ones, humiliated and
        subjected through love, with true and holy obedience, who do not kick
        against the pricks of their order or superior, exalted by Me, the
        supreme and eternal Father, with the true citizens of the blessed life,
        when they are rewarded for all their labors, and in this life also do
        they taste eternal life." 
          
         How the truly obedient receive a hundredfold for one, and also
        eternal lift; and what is meant by this one, and this hundredfold. 
          
         "In them is fulfilled the saying of the sweet and amorous Word,
        My only-begotten Son, in the gospel when He replied to Peter's demand,
        'Master, we have left everything for your love's sake, and have followed
        You, what will you give us?' My Truth replied, 'I will give you a
        hundredfold for one, and you shall possess eternal life.' As if My Truth
        had wished to say, 'You have done well, Peter, for in no other way could
        you follow Me. And I, in this life, will give you a hundredfold for
        one.' And what is this hundredfold, beloved daughter, besides which the
        apostle obtained eternal life? To what did My Truth refer? To temporal
        substance? 
         "Properly speaking, no. Do I not, however, often cause one who
        gives alms to multiply in temporal goods? In return for what do I this?
        In return for the gift of his own will. This is the one for which I
        repay him a hundredfold. What is the meaning of the number a hundred? A
        hundred is a perfect number, and cannot be added to except by
        recommencing from the first. So charity is the most perfect of all the
        virtues, so perfect that no higher virtue can be attained except by
        recommencing at the beginning of self- knowledge, and thus increasing
        many hundredfold in merit; but you always necessarily arrive at the
        number one hundred. This is that hundredfold which is given to those who
        have given Me the unit of their own will, both in general obedience, and
        in the particular obedience of the religious life. And in addition to
        this hundred you also possess eternal life, for charity alone enters
        into eternal life, like a mistress bringing with her the fruit of all
        the other virtues, while they remain outside, bringing their fruit, I
        say, into Me, the eternal life, in whom the obedient taste eternal life.
        It is not by faith that they taste eternal life, for they experience in
        its essence that which they have believed through faith; nor by hope,
        for they possess that for which they had hoped, and so with all the
        other virtues, Queen Charity alone enters and possesses Me, her
        possessor. See, therefore, that these little ones receive a hundredfold
        for one, and also eternal life, for here they receive the fire of divine
        charity figured by the number of a hundred (as has been said). And
        because they have received this hundredfold from Me, they possess a
        wonderful and hearty joy, for there is no sadness in charity, but the
        joy of it makes the heart large and generous, not narrow or double. A
        soul wounded by this sweet arrow does not appear one thing in face and
        tongue while her heart is different. She does not serve, or act towards
        her neighbor with dissembling and ambition, because charity is an open
        book to be read by all. Wherefore the soul who possesses charity never
        falls into trouble, or the affliction of sadness, or jars with
        obedience, remains obedient until death." 
          
         Of the perversities, miseries, and labors of the disobedient man; and
        of the miserable fruits which proceed from disobedience. 
          
         "Contrariwise, a wicked disobedient man dwells in the ship of a
        religious order with so much pain to himself and others, that in this
        life he tastes the earnest of hell, he remains always in sadness and
        confusion of mind, tormented by the sting of conscience, with hatred of
        his order and superior, insupportable to himself. What a terrible thing
        it is, My daughter, to see one who has once taken the key of obedience
        of a religious order, living in disobedience, to which he has made
        himself a slave, for of disobedience he has made his mistress with her
        companion impatience, nourished by pride, and his own pleasure, which
        pride (as has been said) issues from self-love. For him everything is
        the contrary to what it would be for the obedient man. For how can this
        wretch be in any other state than suffering, for he is deprived of
        charity, he is obliged by force to incline the neck of his own will, and
        pride keeps it erect, all his desires are in discord with the will of
        the order. The order commands obedience, and he loves disobedience; the
        order commands voluntary poverty, and he avoids it, possessing and
        acquiring riches; the order commands continence and purity, and he
        desires lewdness. By transgressing these three vows, My daughter, a
        religious comes to ruin, and falls into so many miseries, that his
        aspect is no longer that of a religious but of an incarnate devil, as in
        another place I related to you at greater length. I will, however, tell
        you something now of their delusion, and of the fruit which they
        obtained by disobedience to the commendation and exhortation of
        obedience. This wretched man is deluded by his self-love, because the
        eye of his intellect is fixed, with a dead faith, on pleasing his
        self-will, and on things of the world. He left the world in body, but
        remained there in his affections, and because obedience seems wearisome
        to him he wishes to disobey in order to avoid weariness; whereby he
        arrives at the greatest weariness of all, for he is obliged to obey
        either by force or by love, and it would have been better and less
        wearisome to have obeyed by love than without it. Oh! how deluded he is,
        and no one else deceives him but himself. Wishing to please himself he
        only gives himself displeasure, for the actions which he will have to
        do, through the obedience imposed on him, do not please him. He wishes
        to enjoy delights and make this life his eternity, but the order wishes
        him to be a pilgrim, and continually proves it to him; for when he is in
        a nice pleasant resting place, where he would like to remain for the
        pleasures and delights he finds there, he is transferred elsewhere, and
        the change gives him pain, for his will was active against his
        obedience, and yet he is obliged to endure the discipline and labors of
        the order, and thus remains in continual torment. See, therefore, how he
        deludes himself; for, wishing to fly pain, he on the contrary falls into
        it, for his blindness does not let him know the road of true obedience,
        which is a road of truth founded by the obedient Lamb, My only-begotten
        Son, who removed pain from it, so that he walks by the road of lies,
        believing that he will find delight there, but finding on the contrary
        pain and bitterness. Who is his guide? Self-love, that is his own
        passion for disobedience. Such a man thinks like a fool to navigate this
        tempestuous sea, with the strength of his own arms, trusting in his own
        miserable knowledge, and will not navigate it in the arms of his order,
        and of his superior. Such a one is indeed in the ship of the order in
        body, and not in mind; he has quitted it in desire, not observing the
        regulations or customs of the order, nor the three vows which he
        promised to observe at the time of his profession; he swims in the
        tempestuous sea, tossed to and fro by contrary winds, fastened only to
        the ship by his clothes, wearing the religious habit on his body but not
        on his heart. Such a one is no friar, but a masquerader, a man only in
        appearance. His life is lower than an animal's, and he does not see that
        he labors more swimming with his arms, than the good religious in the
        ship, or that he is in danger of eternal death; for if his clothes
        should be suddenly torn from the ship, which will happen at the moment
        of death, he will have no remedy. No, he does not see, for he has
        darkened his light with the cloud of self-love, whence has come his
        disobedience, which prevents him seeing his misery, wherefore he
        miserably deceives himself. What fruit is produced by this wretched
        tree? 
         "The fruit of death, because the root of his affection is
        planted in pride, which he has drawn from self-love. Wherefore
        everything that issues from this root -- flowers, leaves, and fruit --
        is corrupt, and the three boughs of this tree, which are obedience,
        poverty, and continence, which spring from the foot of the tree; that
        is, his affections are corrupted. The leaves produced by this tree,
        which are his words, are so corrupt that they would be out of place in
        the mouth of a ribald secular; and if he have to preach My doctrine, he
        does so in polished terms, not simply, as one who should feed souls with
        the seed of My Word, but with eloquent language. Look at the stinking
        flowers of this tree, which are his diverse and various thoughts, which
        he voluntarily welcomes with delight and pleasure, not flying the
        occasions of them, but rather seeking them in order to be able to
        accomplish a sinful act, the which is the fruit which kills him,
        depriving him of the light of grace, and giving him eternal death. And
        what stench comes from this fruit, sprung from the flowers of the tree?
        The stench of disobedience, for, in the secret of his heart, he wishes
        to examine and judge unfaithfully his superior's will; a stench of
        impurity, for he takes delight in many foul conversations, wretchedly
        tempting his penitents. 
         "Wretch that you are, do you not see that under the color of
        devotion you conceal a troop of children? This comes from your
        disobedience. You have not chosen the virtues for your children as does
        the truly obedient religious; you strive to deceive your superior when
        you see that he denies you something which your perverse will desires,
        using the leaves of smooth or rough words, speaking irreverently and
        reproving him. You can not endure your brother, nor even the smallest
        word and reproof which he may make to you, but in such a case you
        immediately bring forth the poisoned fruit of anger and hatred against
        him, judging that to be done to your hurt which was done for your good,
        and thus taking scandal, your soul and body living in pain. Why has your
        brother displeased you? Because you live for your own sensual pleasure,
        you fly your cell as if it were a prison, for you have abandoned the
        cell of self-knowledge, and thus fallen into disobedience, wherefore you
        can not remain in your material cell. You will not appear in the
        refectory against your will whilst you have anything to spend; when you
        have nothing left necessity takes you there. 
         "Therefore the obedient have done well, who have chosen to
        observe their vow of poverty, so that they have nothing to spend, and
        therefore are not led away from the sweet table of the refectory, where
        obedience nourishes both body and soul in peace and quiet. The obedient
        religious does not think of laying a table, or of providing food for
        himself like this wretched man, to whose taste it is painful to eat in
        the refectory, wherefore he avoids it; he is always the last to enter
        the choir, and the first to leave it; with his lips he approaches Me,
        with his heart he is far from Me. He gladly escapes from the
        chapter-house when he can through fear of penance. When he is obliged to
        be there, he is covered with shame and confusion for the faults which he
        felt it no shame to commit. What is the cause of this? Disobedience. He
        does not watch in prayer, and not only does he omit mental prayer, but
        even the Divine office to which he is obliged. He has no fraternal
        charity, because he loves no one but himself, and that not with a
        reasonable but with a bestial love. So great are the evils which fall on
        the disobedient; so many are the fruits of sorrow which he produces,
        that your tongue could not relate them. Oh! disobedience, which deprives
        the soul of the light of obedience, destroying peace, and giving war!
        Disobedience destroys life and gives death, drawing the religious out of
        the ship of the observance of his order, to drown him in the sea, making
        him swim in the strength of his own arms, and not repose on those of the
        order. Disobedience clothes him with every misery, causes him to die of
        hunger, taking away from him the food of the merit of obedience, it
        gives him continual bitterness, depriving him of every sweetness and
        good, causing him to dwell with every evil in life it gives him the
        earnest of cruel torments to endure, and if he do not amend before his
        clothes are loosened from the ship at death, disobedience will lead the
        soul to eternal damnation, together with the devils who fell from
        heaven, because they rebelled against Me. In the same way have you, oh!
        disobedient man, having rebelled against obedience and cast from you the
        key which would have opened the door of heaven, opened instead the door
        of hell with the key of disobedience." 
          
         How God does not reward merit according to the labor of the obedient,
        nor according to the length of time which it takes, but according to the
        love and promptitude of the truly obedient; and of the miracles which
        God has performed by means of this virtue; and of discretion in
        obedience, and of the works and reward of the truly obedient man. 
          
         "I have appointed you all to labor in the vineyard of obedience
        in different ways, and every man will receive a price, according to the
        measure of his love, and not according to the work he does, or the
        length of time for which he works, that is to say, that he who comes
        early will not have more than he who comes late, as My Truth told you in
        the holy gospel by the example of those who were standing idle and were
        sent by the lord of the vineyard to labor; for he gave as much to those
        who went at dawn, as to those who went at prime or at tierce, and those
        who went at sext, at none, and even at vespers, received as much as the
        first: My Truth showing you in this way that you are rewarded not
        according to time or work, but according to the measure of your love.
        Many are placed in their childhood to work in the vineyard; some enter
        later in life, and others in old age; sometimes these latter labor with
        such fire of love, seeing the shortness of the time, that they rejoin
        those who entered in their childhood, because they have advanced but
        slowly. By love of obedience, then, does the soul receive her merit,
        filling the vessel of her heart in Me, the Sea Pacific. There are many
        whose obedience is so prompt, and has become, as it were, so incarnate
        in them, that not only do they wish to see reason in what is ordered
        them by their superior, but they hardly wait until the word is out of
        his mouth, for with the light of faith they understand his intention.
        Wherefore the truly obedient man obeys rather the intention than the
        word, judging that the will of his superior is fixed in My will, and
        that therefore his command comes from My dispensation, and from My will,
        wherefore I say to you that he rather obeys the intention than the word.
        He also obeys the word, having first spiritually obeyed in affection his
        superior's will, seeing and judging it by the light of faith to be Mine.
        This is well shown in the lives of the fathers, where you read of a
        religious, who at once obeyed in his affection the command of his
        superior, commencing to write the letter o, though he had not space to
        finish it; wherefore to show how pleasing his prompt obedience was to
        Me, My clemency gave him a proof by writing the other half of the letter
        in gold. This glorious virtue is so pleasing to Me, that to no other
        have I given so many miraculous signs and testimonies, for it proceeds
        from the height of faith. 
         "In order to show how pleasing it is to Me, the earth obeys this
        virtue, the animals obey it -- water grows solid under the feet of the
        obedient man. And as for the obedience of the earth, you remember having
        read of that disciple who, being given a dry stick by his abbot, and
        being ordered by obedience to plant it in the earth and water it every
        day, did not proceed to ask how could it possibly do any good, but,
        without inquiring about possibilities, he fulfilled his obedience in
        such virtue of faith that the dry wood brought forth leaves and fruits,
        as a sign that that soul had risen from the dryness of disobedience,
        and, covered by the green leaves of virtue, had brought forth the fruit
        of obedience, wherefore the fruit of this tree was called by the holy
        fathers the fruit of obedience. You will also find that animals obey the
        obedient man; for a certain disciple, commanded by obedience, through
        his purity and virtue caught a dragon and brought it to his abbot, but
        the abbot, like a true physician of the soul, in order that he might not
        be tossed about by the wind of vainglory, and to prove his patience,
        sent him away with harsh words, saying: 'Beast that you are, you have
        brought along another beast with yourself.' And as to fire, you have
        read in the holy scripture that many were placed in the fire, rather
        than transgress My obedience, and, at My command were not hurt by it.
        This was the case of the three children, who remained happily in the
        furnace -- and of many others of whom I could tell you. The water bore
        up Maurus who had been sent by obedience to save a drowning disciple; he
        did not think of himself, but thought only with the light of faith of
        how to fulfill the command of his superior, and so walked upon the water
        as if he had been on dry land, and so saved the disciple. In everything,
        if you open the eye of the intellect, you will find shown forth the
        excellence of this virtue. Everything else should be abandoned for the
        sake of obedience. If you were lifted up in such contemplation and union
        of mind with Me, that your body was raised from the earth, and an
        obedience were imposed on you (speaking generally, and not in a
        particular case, which cannot give a law), you ought, if possible, to
        force yourself to arise, to fulfill the obedience imposed on you, though
        you should never leave prayer, except for necessity, charity, or
        obedience. I say this in order that you may see how prompt I wish the
        obedience of My servants to be, and how pleasing it is to Me. Everything
        that the obedient man does is a source of merit to him. If he eats,
        obedience is his food; if he sleeps, his dreams are obedience; if he
        walks, if he remains still, if he fasts, if he watches -- everything
        that he does is obedience; if he serve his neighbor, it is obedience
        that he serves. How is he guided in the choir, in the refectory, or his
        cell? By obedience, with the light of the most holy faith, with which
        light he has slain and cast from him his humbled self-will, and
        abandoned himself with self-hatred to the arms of his order and
        superior. Reposing with obedience in the ship, allowing himself to be
        guided by his superior, he has navigated the tempestuous sea of this
        life, with calm and serene mind and tranquillity of heart, because
        obedience and faith have taken all darkness from him; he remains strong
        and firm, having lost all weakness and fear, having destroyed his own
        will, from which comes all feebleness and disordinate fear. And what is
        the food of this spouse obedience? She eats knowledge of self, and of
        Me, knowing her own non- existence and sinfulness, and knowing that I am
        He who is, thus eating and knowing My Truth in the Incarnate Word. What
        does she drink? The Blood, in which the Word has shown her, My Truth,
        and the ineffable love which I have for her, and the obedience imposed
        on Him by Me, His Eternal Father, so she becomes inebriated with the
        love and obedience of the Word, losing herself and her own opinions and
        knowledge, and possessing Me by grace, tasting Me by love, with the
        light of faith in holy obedience. 
         "The obedient man speaks words of peace all his life, and at his
        death receives that which was promised him at his death by his superior,
        that is to say, eternal life, the vision of peace, and of supreme and
        eternal tranquillity and rest, the inestimable good which no one can
        value or understand, for, being the infinite good, it cannot be
        understood by anything smaller than itself, like a vessel, which, dipped
        into the sea, does not comprehend the whole sea, but only that quantity
        which it contains. The sea alone contains itself. So I, the Sea Pacific,
        am He who alone can comprehend and value Myself truly. And in My own
        estimate and comprehension of Myself I rejoice, and this joy, the good
        which I have in Myself, I share with you, and with all, according to the
        measure of each. I do not leave you empty, but fill you, giving you
        perfect beatitude; each man comprehends and knows My goodness in the
        measure in which it is given to him. Thus, then, the obedient man, with
        the light of faith in the truth burning in the furnace of charity,
        anointed with humility, inebriated with the Blood, in company with his
        sister patience, and with self- contempt, fortitude, and enduring
        perseverance, and all the other virtues (that is, with the fruit of the
        virtues), receives his end from Me, his Creator." 
          
         This is a brief repetition of the entire book. 
          
         "I have now, oh dearest and best beloved daughter, satisfied
        from the beginning to the end your desire concerning obedience. 
         "If you remember well, you made four petitions of Me with
        anxious desire, or rather I caused you to make them in order to increase
        the fire of My love in your soul: one for yourself, which I have
        satisfied, illuminating you with My Truth, and showing you how you may
        know this truth which you desired to know; explaining to you how you
        might come to the knowledge of it through the knowledge of yourself and
        Me, through the light of faith. The second request you made of Me was
        that I should do mercy to the world. In the third you prayed for the
        mystical body of the holy Church, that I would remove darkness and
        persecutions from it, punishing its iniquities at own desire in your
        person. As to this I explained that no penalty inflicted in finite time
        can satisfy for a sin committed against Me, the Infinite Good, unless it
        is united with the desire of the soul and contrition of the heart. How
        this is to be done I have explained to you. I have also told you that I
        wish to do mercy to the world, proving to you that mercy is My special
        attribute, for through the mercy and the inestimable love which I had
        for man, I sent to the earth the Word, My only-begotten Son, whom, that
        you might understand things quite clearly, I represented to you under
        the figure of a Bridge, reaching from earth to heaven, through the union
        of My divinity with your human nature. 
         "I also showed you, to give you further light concerning My
        truth, how this Bridge is built on three steps; that is, on the three
        powers of the soul. These three steps I also represented to you, as you
        know, under figures of your body -- the feet, the side, and the mouth --
        by which I also figured three states of soul -- the imperfect state, the
        perfect state, and the most perfect state, in which the soul arrives at
        the excellence of unitive love. I have shown you clearly in each state
        the means of cutting away imperfection and reaching perfection, and how
        the soul may know by which road she is walking and of the hidden
        delusions of the devil and of spiritual self-love. Speaking of these
        three states I have also spoken of the three judgments which My clemency
        delivers -- one in this life, the second at death on those who die in
        mortal sin without hope, of whom I told you that they went under the
        Bridge by the Devil's road, when I spoke to you of their wretchedness.
        And the third is that of the last and universal judgment. And I who told
        you somewhat of the suffering of the damned and the glory of the
        blessed, when all shall have reassumed their bodies given by Me, also
        promised you, and now again I repeat my promise, that through the long
        endurance of My servants I will reform My spouse. Wherefore I invite you
        to endure, Myself lamenting with you over her iniquities. And I have
        shown you the excellence of the ministers I have given her, and the
        reverence in which I wish seculars to hold them, showing you the reason
        why their reverence towards My ministers should not diminish on account
        of the sins of the latter, and how displeasing to me is such diminution
        of reverence; and of the virtue of those who live like angels. And while
        speaking to you on this subject, I also touched on the excellence of the
        sacraments. And further wishing you to know of the states of tears and
        whence they proceed, I spoke to you on the subject and told you that all
        tears issue from the fountain of the heart, and pointed out their causes
        to you in order. 
         "I told you not only of the four states of tears, but also of
        the fifth, which germinates death. I have also answered your fourth
        request, that I would provide for the particular case of an individual;
        I have provided as you know. Further than this, I have explained My
        providence to you, in general and in particular, showing you how
        everything is made by divine providence, from the first beginning of the
        world until the end, giving you and permitting everything to happen to
        you, both tribulations and consolations temporal and spiritual, and
        every circumstance of your life for your good, in order that you may be
        sanctified in Me, and My Truth be fulfilled in you, which truth is that
        I created you in order to possess eternal life, and manifested this with
        the blood of My only-begotten Son, the Word. 
         "I have also in My last words fulfilled your desire and My
        promise to speak of the perfection of obedience and the imperfection of
        disobedience; and how obedience can be obtained and how destroyed. I
        have shown it to you as a universal key, and so it is. I have also
        spoken to you of particular obedience, and of the perfect and imperfect,
        and of those in religion, and of those in the world, explaining the
        condition of each distinctly to you, and of the peace given by
        obedience, and the war of disobedience, and how the disobedient man is
        deceived, showing you how death came into the world by the disobedience
        of Adam, and how I, the Eternal Father, supreme and eternal Truth, give
        you this conclusion of the whole matter, that in the obedience of the
        only-begotten Word, My Son, you have life, and as from that first old
        man you contracted the infection of death, so all of you who will take
        the key of obedience have contracted the infection of the life of the
        new Man, sweet Jesus, of whom I made a Bridge, the road to Heaven being
        broken. And now I urge you and My other servants to grief, for by your
        grief and humble and continual prayer I will do mercy to the world. Die
        to the world and hasten along this way of truth, so as not to be taken
        prisoner if you go slowly. I demand this of you now more than at first,
        for now I have manifested to you My Truth. Beware that you never leave
        the cell of self-knowledge, but in this cell preserve and spend the
        treasure which I have given you, which is a doctrine of truth founded
        upon the living stone, sweet Christ Jesus, clothed in light which
        scatters darkness, with which doctrine clothe yourself, My best beloved
        and sweetest daughter, in the truth." 
          
         How this most devout soul, thanking and praising God, makes prayer
        for the whole world and for the Holy Church, and commending the virtue
        of faith brings this work to an end. 
          
         Then that soul, having seen with the eye of the intellect, and having
        known by the light of holy faith the truth and excellence of obedience,
        hearing and tasting it with love and ecstatic desire, gazed upon the
        divine majesty and gave thanks to Him, saying, "Thanks, thanks to
        You, oh eternal Father, for You have not despised me, the work of Your
        hands, nor turned Your face from me, nor despised my desires; You, the
        Light, have not regarded my darkness; You, true Life, have not regarded
        my living death; You, the Physician, have not been repelled by my grave
        infirmities; You, the eternal Purity, have not considered the many
        miseries of which I am full; You, who are the Infinite, have overlooked
        that I am finite; You, who are Wisdom, have overlooked my folly; Your
        wisdom, Your goodness, Your clemency, Your infinite good, have
        overlooked these infinite evils and sins, and the many others which are
        in me. Having known the truth through Your clemency, I have found Your
        charity, and the love of my neighbor. What has constrained me? Not my
        virtues, but only Your charity. May that same charity constrain You to
        illuminate the eye of my intellect with the light of faith, so that I
        may know and understand the truth which You have manifested to me. Grant
        that my memory may be capable of retaining Your benefits, that my will
        may burn in the fire of Your charity, and may that fire so work in me
        that I give my body to blood, and that by that blood given for love of
        the Blood, together with the key of obedience, I may unlock the door of
        Heaven. I ask this of You with all my heart, forevery rational creature,
        both in general and in particular, in the mystical body of the holy
        Church. I confess and do not deny that You loved me before I existed,
        and that Your love for me is ineffable, as if You were mad with love for
        Your creature. Oh, eternal Trinity! oh Godhead! which Godhead gave value
        to the Blood of Your Son, You, oh eternal Trinity, are a deep Sea, into
        which the deeper I enter the more I find, and the more I find the more I
        seek; the soul cannot be satiated in Your abyss, for she continually
        hungers after You, the eternal Trinity, desiring to see You with light
        in Your light. As the hart desires the spring of living water, so my
        soul desires to leave the prison of this dark body and see You in truth.
        How long, oh! Eternal Trinity, fire and abyss of love, will Your face be
        hidden from my eyes? Melt at once the cloud of my body. The knowledge
        which You have given me of Yourself in Your truth, constrains me to long
        to abandon the heaviness of my body, and to give my life for the glory
        and praise of Your Name, for I have tasted and seen with the light of
        the intellect in Your light, the abyss of You -- the eternal Trinity,
        and the beauty of Your creature, for, looking at myself in You, I saw
        myself to be Your image, my life being given me by Your power, oh!
        eternal Father, and Your wisdom, which belongs to Your only-begotten
        Son, shining in my intellect and my will, being one with Your Holy
        Spirit, who proceeds from You and Your Son, by whom I am able to love
        You. You, Eternal Trinity, are my Creator, and I am the work of Your
        hands, and I know through the new creation which You have given me in
        the blood of Your Son, that You are enamored of the beauty of Your
        workmanship. Oh! Abyss, oh! Eternal Godhead, oh! Sea Profound! what more
        could You give me than Yourself; You are the fire which ever burns
        without being consumed; You consume in Your heat all the soul's
        self-love; You are the fire which takes away all cold; with Your light
        You do illuminate me so that I may know all Your truth; You are that
        light above all light, which illuminates supernaturally the eye of my
        intellect, clarifying the light of faith so abundantly and so perfectly,
        that I see that my soul is alive, and in this light receives You -- the
        true light. By the Light of faith I have acquired wisdom in the wisdom
        of the Word -- Your only-begotten Son. In the light of faith I am
        strong, constant, and persevering. In the light of faith I hope, suffer
        me not to faint by the way. This light, without which I should still
        walk in darkness, teaches me the road, and for this I said, Oh! Eternal
        Father, that You have illuminated me with the light of holy faith. Of a
        truth this light is a sea, for the soul revels in You, Eternal Trinity,
        the Sea Pacific. The water of the sea is not turbid, and causes no fear
        to the soul, for she knows the truth; it is a deep which manifests sweet
        secrets, so that where the light of Your faith abounds, the soul is
        certain of what she believes. This water is a magic mirror into which
        You, the Eternal Trinity, bid me gaze, holding it with the hand of love,
        that I may see myself, who am Your creature, there represented in You,
        and Yourself in me through the union which You made of Your godhead with
        our humanity. For this light I know to represent to myself You -- the
        Supreme and Infinite Good, Good Blessed and Incomprehensible, Good
        Inestimable. Beauty above all beauty; Wisdom above all wisdom -- for You
        are wisdom itself. You, the food of the angels, have given Yourself in a
        fire of love to men; You, the garment which covers all our nakedness,
        feed the hungry with Your sweetness. Oh! Sweet, without any bitter, oh!
        Eternal Trinity, I have known in Your light, which You have given me
        with the light of holy faith, the many and wonderful things You have
        declared to me, explaining to me the path of supreme perfection, so that
        I may no longer serve You in darkness, but with light, and that I may be
        the mirror of a good and holy life, and arise from my miserable sins,
        for through them I have hitherto served You in darkness. I have not
        known Your truth and have not loved it. Why did I not know You? Because
        I did not see You with the glorious light of the holy faith; because the
        cloud of self-love darkened the eye of my intellect, and You, the
        Eternal Trinity, have dissipated the darkness with Your light. Who can
        attain to Your Greatness, and give You thanks for such immeasurable
        gifts and benefits as You have given me in this doctrine of truth, which
        has been a special grace over and above the ordinary graces which You
        give also to Your other creatures? You have been willing to condescend
        to my need and to that of Your creatures -- the need of introspection.
        Having first given the grace to ask the question, You reply to it, and
        satisfy Your servant, penetrating me with a ray of grace, so that in
        that light I may give You thanks. Clothe me, clothe me with You, oh!
        Eternal Truth, that I may run my mortal course with true obedience and
        the light of holy faith, with which light I feel that my soul is about
        to become inebriated afresh." 
          
             Letter of Ser Barduccio di Piero Canigiani, containing the Transit of
        the Seraphic Virgin, Saint Catherine of Siena, to Sister Catherine
        Petriboni in the Monastery of San Piero a Monticelli near Florence. In
        the Name of Jesus Christ.   
         Dearest Mother in Christ Jesus, and Sister in the holy memory of our
        blessed mother Catherine, I, Barduccio, a wretched and guilty sinner,
        recommend myself to your holy prayers as a feeble infant, orphaned by
        the death of so great a mother. I received your letter and read it with
        much pleasure, and communicated it to my afflicted mothers here, who,
        supremely grateful for your great charity and tender love towards them,
        recommend themselves greatly, for their part, to your prayers, and beg
        you to recommend them to the Prioress and all the sisters that they may
        be ready to do all that may be pleasing to God concerning themselves and
        you. But since you, as a beloved and faithful daughter, desire to know
        the end of our common mother, I am constrained to satisfy your desire;
        and although I know myself to be but little fitted to give such a
        narration, I will write in any case what my feeble eyes have seen, and
        what the dull senses of my soul have been able to comprehend. 
         This blessed virgin and mother of thousands of souls, about the feast
        of the Circumcision, began to feel so great a change both in soul and
        body, that she was obliged to alter her mode of life, the action of
        taking food for her sustenance becoming so loathsome to her, that it was
        only with the greatest difficulty that she could force herself to take
        any, and, when she did so, she swallowed nothing of the substance of the
        food, but had the habit of rejecting it. Moreover, not one drop of water
        could she swallow for refreshment, whence came to her a most violent and
        tedious thirst, and so great an inflammation of her throat that her
        breath seemed to be fire, with all which, however, she remained in very
        good health, robust and fresh as usual. In these conditions we reached
        Sexagesima Sunday, when, about the hour of vespers, at the time of her
        prayer, she had so violent a stroke that from that day onwards she was
        no longer in health. Towards the night of the following Monday, just
        after I had written a letter, she had another stroke so terrific, that
        we all mourned her as dead, remaining under it for a long time without
        giving any sign of life. Then, rising, she stood for an equal space of
        time, and did not seem the same person as she who had fallen. 
         From that hour began new travail and bitter pains in her body, and,
        Lent having arrived, she began, in spite of her infirmity, to give
        herself with such application of mind to prayer that the frequency of
        the humble sighs and sorrowful plaints which she exhaled from the depth
        of her heart appeared to us a miracle. I think, too, that you know that
        her prayers were so fervent that one hour spent in prayer by her reduced
        that dear tender frame to greater weakness than would be suffered by one
        who should persist for two whole days in prayer. Meanwhile, every
        morning, after communion, she arose from the earth in such a state that
        any one who had seen her would have thought her dead, and was thus
        carried back to bed. Thence, after an hour or two, she would arise
        afresh, and we would go to St. Peter's, although a good mile distant,
        where she would place herself in prayer, so remaining until vespers,
        finally returning to the house so worn out that she seemed a corpse. 
         These were her exercises up till the third Sunday in Lent, when she
        finally succumbed, conquered by the innumerable sufferings, which daily
        increased, and consumed her body, and the infinite afflictions of the
        soul which she derived from the consideration of the sins which she saw
        being committed against God, and from the dangers ever more grave to
        which she knew the Holy Church to be exposed, on account of which she
        remained greatly overcome, and both internally and externally tormented.
        She lay in this state for eight weeks, unable to lift her head, and full
        of intolerable pains, from the soles of her feet to the crown of her
        head, to such an extent that she would often say: "These pains are
        truly physical, but not natural; for it seems that God has given
        permission to the devils to torment this body at their pleasure."
        And, in truth, it evidently was so; for, if I were to attempt to explain
        the patience which she practiced, under this terrible and unheard-of
        agony, I should fear to injure, by my explanations, facts which cannot
        be explained. This only will I say, that, every time that a new torment
        came upon her, she would joyously raise her eyes and her heart to God
        and say: "Thanks to You, oh eternal Spouse, for granting such
        graces afresh every day to me, Your miserable and most unworthy
        handmaid!" 
         In this way her body continued to consume itself until the Sunday
        before the Ascension; but by that time it was reduced to such a state
        that it seemed like a corpse in a picture, though I speak not of the
        face, which remained ever angelical and breathed forth devotion, but of
        the bosom and limbs, in which nothing could be seen but the bones,
        covered by the thinnest skin, and so feeble was she from the waist
        downwards that she could not move herself, even a little, from one side
        to another. In the night preceding the aforesaid Sunday, about two hours
        or more before dawn, a great change was produced in her, and we thought
        that she was approaching the end. The whole family was then called
        around her, and she, with singular humility and devotion, made signs to
        those who were standing near that she desired to receive Holy Absolution
        for her faults and the pains due to them, and so it was done. After
        which she became gradually reduced to such a state that we could observe
        no other movement than her breathing, continuous, sad, and feeble. On
        account of this it seemed right to give her extreme unction, which our
        abbot of Sant' Antimo did, while she lay as it were deprived of feeling. 
         After this unction she began altogether to change, and to make
        various signs with her head and her arms as if to show that she was
        suffering from grave assaults of demons, and remained in this calamitous
        state for an hour and a half, half of which time having been passed in
        silence, she began to say: "I have sinned! Oh Lord, have mercy on
        me!" And this, as I believe, she repeated more than sixty times,
        raising each time her right arm, and then letting it fall and strike the
        bed. Then, changing her words, she said as many times again, but without
        moving her arms, "Holy God, have mercy on me!" Finally she
        employed the remainder of the above-mentioned time with many other
        formulas of prayer both humble and devout, expressing various acts of
        virtue, after which her face suddenly changed from gloom to angelic
        light, and her tearful and clouded eyes became serene and joyous, in
        such a manner that I could not doubt that, like one saved from a deep
        sea, she was restored to herself, which circumstance greatly mitigated
        the grief of her sons and daughters who were standing around in the
        affliction you can imagine. 
         Catherine had been lying on the bosom of Mother Alessia and now
        succeeded in rising, and with a little help began to sit up, leaning
        against the same mother. In the meantime we had put before her eyes a
        pious picture, containing many relics and various pictures of the
        saints. She, however, fixed her eyes on the image of the cross set in
        it, and began to adore it, explaining, in words, certain of her most
        profound feelings of the goodness of God, and while she prayed, she
        accused herself in general of all her sins in the sight of God, and, in
        particular, said: "It is my fault, oh eternal Trinity, that I have
        offended You so miserably with my negligence, ignorance, ingratitude,
        and disobedience, and many other defects. Wretch that I am! for I have
        not observed Your commandments, either those which are given in general
        to all, or those which Your goodness laid upon me in particular! Oh mean
        creature that I am!" Saying which, she struck her breast, repeating
        her confession, and continued: "I have not observed Your precept,
        with which You commanded me to seek always to give You honor, and to
        spend myself in labors for my neighbor, while I, on the contrary, have
        fled from labors, especially where they were necessary. Did You not
        command me, oh, my God! to abandon all thought of myself and to consider
        solely the praise and glory of Your Name in the salvation of souls, and
        with this food alone, taken from the table of the most holy Cross, to
        comfort myself? But I have sought my own consolation. You did ever
        invite me to bind myself to You alone by sweet, loving, and fervent
        desires, by tears and humble and continuous prayers for the salvation of
        the whole world and for the reformation of the holy Church, promising me
        that, on account of them, You would use mercy with the world, and give
        new beauty to Your Spouse; but I, wretched one, have not corresponded
        with Your desire, but have remained asleep in the bed of negligence. 
         "Oh, unhappy that I am! You have placed me in charge of souls,
        assigning to me so many beloved sons, that I should love them with
        singular love and direct them to You by the way of Life, but I have been
        to them nothing but a mirror of human weakness; I have had no care of
        them; I have not helped them with continuous and humble prayer in Your
        presence, nor have I given them sufficient examples of the good life or
        the warnings of salutary doctrine. Oh, mean creature that I am! with how
        little reverence have I received Your innumerable gifts, the graces of
        such sweet torments and labors which it pleased You to accumulate on
        this fragile body, nor have I endured them with that burning desire and
        ardent love with which You sent them to me. Alas! oh, my Love, through
        Your excessive goodness You chose me for Your spouse, from the beginning
        of my childhood, but I was not faithful enough; in fact, I was
        unfaithful to You, because I did not keep my memory faithful to You
        alone and to Your most high benefits; nor have I fixed my intelligence
        on the thought of them only or disposed my will to love You immediately
        with all its strength." 
         Of these and many other similar things did that pure dove accuse
        herself, rather, as I think, for our example than for her own need, and
        then, turning to the priest, said: "For the love of Christ
        crucified, absolve me of all these sins which I have confessed in the
        presence of God, and of all the others which I cannot remember."
        That done, she asked again for the plenary indulgence, saying that it
        had been granted her by Pope Gregory and Pope Urban, saying this as one
        an hungered for the Blood of Christ. So I did what she asked, and she,
        keeping her eyes ever fixed on the crucifix, began afresh to adore it
        with the greatest devotion, and to say certain very profound things
        which I, for my sins, was not worthy to understand, and also on account
        of the grief with which I was laboring and the anguish with which her
        throat was oppressed, which was so great that she could hardly utter her
        words, while we, placing our ears to her mouth, were able to catch one
        or two now or again, passing them on from one to the other. After this
        she turned to certain of her sons, who had not been present at a
        memorable discourse, which, many days previously, she had made to the
        whole family, showing us the way of salvation and perfection, and laying
        upon each of us the particular task which he was to perform after her
        death. She now did the same to these others, begging most humbly pardon
        of all for the slight care which she seemed to have had of our
        salvation. Then she said certain things to Lucio and to another, and
        finally to me, and then turned herself straightway to prayer. 
         Oh! had you seen with what humility and reverence she begged and
        received many times the blessing of her most sorrowful mother, all that
        I can say is that it was a bitter sweet to her. How full of tender
        affection was the spectacle of the mother, recommending herself to her
        blessed child, and begging her to obtain a particular grace from God --
        namely, that in these melancholy circumstances she might not offend Him.
        But all these things did not distract the holy virgin from the fervor of
        her prayer; and, approaching her end, she began to pray especially for
        the Catholic Church, for which she declared she was giving her life. She
        prayed again for Pope Urban VI., whom she resolutely confessed to be the
        true Pontiff, and strengthened her sons never to hesitate to give their
        life for that truth. Then, with the greatest fervor, she besought all
        her beloved children whom the Lord had given her, to love Him alone,
        repeating many of the words which our Savior used, when He recommended
        the disciples to the Father, praying with such affection, that, at
        hearing her, not only our hearts, but the very stones might have been
        broken. Finally, making the sign of the cross, she blessed us all, and
        thus continued in prayer to the end of her life for which she had so
        longed, saying: "You, oh Lord, call me, and I come to You, not
        through my merits, but through Your mercy alone, which I ask of You, in
        virtue of Your Blood!" and many times she called out: "Blood,
        Blood!" Finally, after the example of the Savior, she said:
        "Father, into Your Hands I commend my soul and my spirit," and
        thus sweetly, with a face all shining and angelical, she bent her head,
        and gave up the ghost. 
         Her transit occurred on the Sunday at the hour of Sext, but we kept
        her unburied until the hour of Compline on Tuesday, without any odor
        being perceptible, her body remaining so pure, intact, and fragrant,
        that her arms, her neck and her legs remained as flexible as if she were
        still alive. During those three days the body was visited by crowds of
        people, and lucky he thought himself who was able to touch it. Almighty
        God also worked many miracles in that time, which in my hurry I omit.
        Her tomb is visited devoutly by the faithful, like those of the other
        holy bodies which are in Rome, and Almighty God is granting many graces
        in the name of His blessed spouse, and I doubt not that there will be
        many more, and we are made great by hearing of them. I say no more.
        Recommend me to the Prioress and all the sisters, for I have, at
        present, the greatest need of the help of prayer. May Almighty God
        preserve you and help you to grow in His grace.
