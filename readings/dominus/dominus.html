proclaim the Gospel to the whole world and to baptize all nations: “Go into
the whole world and proclaim the Gospel to every creature. He who believes and
is baptized will be saved; he who does not believe will be condemned” (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mk</i>
16:15-16); “All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go
therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have
commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, until the end of the world” (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mt</i>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">The Church's universal mission is born from the command of Jesus Christ
and is fulfilled in the course of the centuries in the proclamation of the
mystery of God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and the mystery of the incarnation
of the Son, as saving event for all humanity. The fundamental contents of the
profession of the Christian faith are expressed thus: “I believe in one God,
the Father, Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all that is, seen and
unseen. I believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally
begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God,
begotten, not made, of one being with the Father. Through him all things were
made. For us men and for our salvation, he came down from heaven: by the power
of the Holy Spirit he became incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For
our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered death and was
buried. On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures; he
ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come
again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no
end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds
from the Father. With the Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified. He
has spoken through the prophets. I believe in one holy catholic and apostolic
Church. I acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. I look for the
resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come”.<sup>1</sup><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the course of the
centuries, the Church has proclaimed and witnessed with fidelity to the Gospel
of Jesus. At the close of the second millennium, however, this mission is still
far from complete.<sup>2</sup> For that reason, Saint Paul's words are now more
relevant than ever: “Preaching the Gospel is not a reason for me to boast; it
is a necessity laid on me: woe to me if I do not preach the Gospel!” (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">1
Cor</i> 9:16). This explains the Magisterium's particular attention to giving
reasons for and supporting the evangelizing mission of the Church, above all in
connection with the religious traditions of the world.<sup>3</sup><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">In considering the values which these religions witness to and offer
humanity, with an open and positive approach, the Second Vatican Council's
Declaration on the relation of the Church to non-Christian religions states:
“The Catholic Church rejects nothing of what is true and holy in these
religions. She has a high regard for the manner of life and conduct, the
precepts and teachings, which, although differing in many ways from her own
teaching, nonetheless often reflect a ray of that truth which enlightens all
men”.<sup>4</sup> Continuing in this line of thought, the Church's
proclamation of Jesus Christ, “the way, the truth, and the life” (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Jn</i> 14:6), today also makes use of the practice of inter-religious
dialogue. Such dialogue certainly does not replace, but rather accompanies the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">missio
ad gentes</i>, directed toward that “mystery of unity”, from which “it
follows that all men and women who are saved share, though differently, in the
same mystery of salvation in Jesus Christ through his Spirit”.<sup>5</sup>
Inter-religious dialogue, which is part of the Church's evangelizing mission,<sup>6</sup>
requires an attitude of understanding and a relationship of mutual knowledge and
reciprocal enrichment, in obedience to the truth and with respect for freedom.<sup>7</sup><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the practice of
dialogue between the Christian faith and other religious traditions, as well as
in seeking to understand its theoretical basis more deeply, new questions arise
that need to be addressed through pursuing new paths of research, advancing
proposals, and suggesting ways of acting that call for attentive discernment. In
this task, the present Declaration seeks to recall to Bishops, theologians, and
all the Catholic faithful, certain indispensable elements of Christian doctrine,
which may help theological reflection in developing solutions consistent with
the contents of the faith and responsive to the pressing needs of contemporary
culture.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">The expository language of the Declaration corresponds to its purpose,
which is not to treat in a systematic manner the question of the unicity and
salvific universality of the mystery of Jesus Christ and the Church, nor to
propose solutions to questions that are matters of free theological debate, but
rather to set forth again the doctrine of the Catholic faith in these areas,
pointing out some fundamental questions that remain open to further development,
and refuting specific positions that are erroneous or ambiguous. For this
reason, the Declaration takes up what has been taught in previous Magisterial
documents, in order to reiterate certain truths that are part of the Church's
faith.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">4.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Church's constant
missionary proclamation is endangered today by relativistic theories which seek
to justify religious pluralism, not only <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">de
facto</i> but also <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">de iure (or in
principle).</i> As a consequence, it is held that certain truths have been
superseded; for example, the definitive and complete character of the revelation
of Jesus Christ, the nature of Christian faith as compared with that of belief
in other religions, the inspired nature of the books of Sacred Scripture, the
personal unity between the Eternal Word and Jesus of Nazareth, the unity of the
economy of the Incarnate Word and the Holy Spirit, the unicity and salvific
universality of the mystery of Jesus Christ, the universal salvific mediation of
the Church, the inseparability — while recognizing the distinction — of the
kingdom of God, the kingdom of Christ, and the Church, and the subsistence of
the one Church of Christ in the Catholic Church.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">The roots of these problems are to be found in certain presuppositions of
both a philosophical and theological nature, which hinder the understanding and
acceptance of the revealed truth. Some of these can be mentioned: the conviction
of the elusiveness and inexpressibility of divine truth, even by Christian
revelation; relativistic attitudes toward truth itself, according to which what
is true for some would not be true for others; the radical opposition posited
between the logical mentality of the West and the symbolic mentality of the
East; the subjectivism which, by regarding reason as the only source of
knowledge, becomes incapable of raising its “gaze to the heights, not daring
to rise to the truth of being”;<sup>8</sup> the difficulty in understanding
and accepting the presence of definitive and eschatological events in history;
the metaphysical emptying of the historical incarnation of the Eternal Logos,
reduced to a mere appearing of God in history; the eclecticism of those who, in
theological research, uncritically absorb ideas from a variety of philosophical
and theological contexts without regard for consistency, systematic connection,
or compatibility with Christian truth; finally, the tendency to read and to
interpret Sacred Scripture outside the Tradition and Magisterium of the Church.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">On the basis of such presuppositions, which may evince different nuances,
certain theological proposals are developed — at times presented as
assertions, and at times as hypotheses — in which Christian revelation and the
mystery of Jesus Christ and the Church lose their character of absolute truth
and salvific universality, or at least shadows of doubt and uncertainty are cast
upon them.<o:p>

EN-US">5.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a remedy for this
relativistic mentality, which is becoming ever more common, it is necessary
above all to reassert the definitive and complete character of the revelation of
Jesus Christ. In fact, it must be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">firmly
believed</i> that, in the mystery of Jesus Christ, the Incarnate Son of God, who
is “the way, the truth, and the life” (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jn</i>
14:6), the full revelation of divine truth is given: “No one knows the Son
except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom
the Son wishes to reveal him” (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mt</i>
11:27); “No one has ever seen God; God the only Son, who is in the bosom of
the Father, has revealed him” (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jn</i>
1:18); “For in Christ the whole fullness of divinity dwells in bodily form”
(<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Col</i> 2:9-10).<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">Faithful to God's word, the Second Vatican Council teaches: “By this
revelation then, the deepest truth about God and the salvation of man shines
forth in Christ, who is at the same time the mediator and the fullness of all
revelation”.<sup>9</sup> Furthermore, “Jesus Christ, therefore, the Word
made flesh, sent ‘as a man to men', ‘speaks the words of God' (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Jn</i> 3:34), and completes the work of salvation which his Father gave
him to do (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jn</i> 5:36; 17:4). To see
Jesus is to see his Father (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jn</i>
14:9). For this reason, Jesus perfected revelation by fulfilling it through his
whole work of making himself present and manifesting himself: through his words
and deeds, his signs and wonders, but especially through his death and glorious
resurrection from the dead and finally with the sending of the Spirit of truth,
he completed and perfected revelation and confirmed it with divine testimony...
The Christian dispensation, therefore, as the new and definitive covenant, will
never pass away, and we now await no further new public revelation before the
glorious manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">1 Tim</i> 6:14 and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tit</i>
2:13)”.<sup>10</sup><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">Thus, the Encyclical <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Redemptoris
missio</i> calls the Church once again to the task of announcing the Gospel as
the fullness of truth: “In this definitive Word of his revelation, God has
made himself known in the fullest possible way. He has revealed to mankind who
he is. This definitive self-revelation of God is the fundamental reason why the
Church is missionary by her very nature. She cannot do other than proclaim the
Gospel, that is, the fullness of the truth which God has enabled us to know
about himself”.<sup>11</sup> Only the revelation of Jesus Christ, therefore,
“introduces into our history a universal and ultimate truth which stirs the
human mind to ceaseless effort”.<sup>12</sup><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">6.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the theory of
the limited, incomplete, or imperfect character of the revelation of Jesus
Christ, which would be complementary to that found in other religions, is
contrary to the Church's faith. Such a position would claim to be based on the
notion that the truth about God cannot be grasped and manifested in its
globality and completeness by any historical religion, neither by Christianity
nor by Jesus Christ.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">Such a position is in radical contradiction with the foregoing statements
of Catholic faith according to which the full and complete revelation of the
salvific mystery of God is given in Jesus Christ. Therefore, the words, deeds,
and entire historical event of Jesus, though limited as human realities, have
nevertheless the divine Person of the Incarnate Word, “true God and true
man”<sup>13</sup> as their subject. For this reason, they possess in
themselves the definitiveness and completeness of the revelation of God's
salvific ways, even if the depth of the divine mystery in itself remains
transcendent and inexhaustible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
truth about God is not abolished or reduced because it is spoken in human
language; rather, it is unique, full, and complete, because he who speaks and
acts is the Incarnate Son of God. Thus, faith requires us to profess that the
Word made flesh, in his entire mystery, who moves from incarnation to
glorification, is the source, participated but real, as well as the fulfilment
of every salvific revelation of God to humanity,<sup>14</sup> and that the Holy
Spirit, who is Christ's Spirit, will teach this “entire truth” (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jn</i>
16:13) to the Apostles and, through them, to the whole Church.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">7.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The proper response to
God's revelation is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">“the obedience of
faith </i>(<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Rom </i>16:26; cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Rom</i> 1:5;<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> 2 Cor</i> 10:5-6) by
which man freely entrusts his entire self to God, offering ‘the full
submission of intellect and will to God who reveals' and freely assenting to the
revelation given by him”.<sup>15</sup> Faith is a gift of grace: “in order
to have faith, the grace of God must come first and give assistance; there must
also be the interior helps of the Holy Spirit, who moves the heart and converts
it to God, who opens the eyes of the mind and gives ‘to everyone joy and ease
in assenting to and believing in the truth'”.<sup>16</sup><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">The obedience of faith implies acceptance of the truth of Christ's
revelation, guaranteed by God, who is Truth itself:<sup>17</sup> “Faith is
first of all a personal adherence of man to God. At the same time, and
inseparably, it is a<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> free assent to the
whole truth that God has revealed”</i>.<sup>18</sup> Faith, therefore, as “<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">a
gift of God</i>” and as “<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">a
supernatural virtue infused by him”</i>,<sup>19</sup> involves a dual
adherence: to God who reveals and to the truth which he reveals, out of the
trust which one has in him who speaks. Thus, “we must believe in no one but
God: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit”.<sup>20</sup><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">For this reason, the distinction between <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">theological faith</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">belief </i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>in
the other religions, must be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">firmly held. </i>If
faith is the acceptance in grace of revealed truth, which “makes it possible
to penetrate the mystery in a way that allows us to understand it coherently”,<sup>21</sup>
then belief, in the other religions, is that sum of experience and thought that
constitutes the human treasury of wisdom and religious aspiration, which man in
his search for truth has conceived and acted upon in his relationship to God and
the Absolute.<sup>22</sup><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">This distinction is not always borne in mind in current theological
reflection. Thus, theological faith (the acceptance of the truth revealed by the
One and Triune God) is often identified with belief in other religions, which is
religious experience still in search of the absolute truth and still lacking
assent to God who reveals himself. This is one of the reasons why the
differences between Christianity and the other religions tend to be reduced at
times to the point of disappearance.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">8.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The hypothesis of the
inspired value of the sacred writings of other religions is also put forward.
Certainly, it must be recognized that there are some elements in these texts
which may be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">de facto</i> instruments by
which countless people throughout the centuries have been and still are able
today to nourish and maintain their life-relationship with God. Thus, as noted
above, the Second Vatican Council, in considering the customs, precepts, and
teachings of the other religions, teaches that “although differing in many
ways from her own teaching, these nevertheless often reflect a ray of that truth
which enlightens all men”.<sup>23</sup><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">The Church's tradition, however, reserves the designation of<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
inspired texts</i> to the canonical books of the Old and New Testaments, since
these are inspired by the Holy Spirit.<sup>24</sup><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Taking up this tradition, the Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation
of the Second Vatican Council states: “For Holy Mother Church, relying on the
faith of the apostolic age, accepts as sacred and canonical the books of the Old
and New Testaments, whole and entire, with all their parts, on the grounds that,
written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jn</i>
20:31; <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">2 Tim</i> 3:16; <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">2 Pet</i> 1:19-21; 3:15-16), they have God as their author, and have
been handed on as such to the Church herself”.<sup>25</sup><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>These books “firmly, faithfully, and without error, teach that truth
which God, for the sake of our salvation, wished to see confided to the Sacred
Scriptures”.<sup>26</sup><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">Nevertheless, God, who desires to call all peoples to himself in Christ
and to communicate to them the fullness of his revelation and love, “does not
fail to make himself present in many ways, not only to individuals, but also to
entire peoples through their spiritual riches, of which their religions are the
main and essential expression even when they contain ‘gaps, insufficiencies
and errors'”.<sup>27</sup> Therefore, the sacred books of other religions,
which in actual fact direct and nourish the existence of their followers,
receive from the mystery of Christ the elements of goodness and grace which they
contain.<o:p>

theological reflection there often emerges an approach to Jesus of Nazareth that
considers him a particular, finite, historical figure, who reveals the divine

salvific figures. The Infinite, the Absolute, the Ultimate Mystery of God would

Jesus of Nazareth would be one of these. More concretely, for some, Jesus would
be one of the many faces which the Logos has assumed in the course of time to
communicate with humanity in a salvific way.<o:p>

not made, one in being with the Father, through whom all things were made, those

children of Adam which had been disfigured since the first sin... As an innocent

Christ is none other than Jesus of Nazareth; he is the Word of God made man for
the salvation of all... In the process of discovering and appreciating the
manifold gifts — especially the spiritual treasures — that God has bestowed
on every people, we cannot separate those gifts from Jesus Christ, who is at the

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">It
is likewise contrary to the Catholic faith to introduce a separation between the
salvific action of the Word as such and that of the Word made man. With the
incarnation, all the salvific actions of the Word of God are always done in
unity with the human nature that he has assumed for the salvation of all people.
The one subject which operates in the two natures, human and divine, is the

fact, the mystery of Christ has its own intrinsic unity, which extends from the
eternal choice in God to the parousia: “he [the Father] chose us in Christ
before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before him in
love” (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

is the mediator and the universal redeemer: “The Word of God, through whom all
things were made, was made flesh, so that as perfect man he could save all men
and sum up all things in himself. The Lord...is he whom the Father raised from
the dead, exalted and placed at his right hand, constituting him judge of the
living and the dead”.<sup>34</sup> This salvific mediation implies also the
unicity of the redemptive sacrifice of Christ, eternal high priest (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Heb</i>

</span>There are also those who propose the hypothesis of an economy of the Holy
Spirit with a more universal breadth than that of the Incarnate Word, crucified
and risen. This position also is contrary to the Catholic faith, which, on the
contrary, considers the salvific incarnation of the Word as a trinitarian event.
In the New Testament, the mystery of Jesus, the Incarnate Word, constitutes the
place of the Holy Spirit's presence as well as the principle of the Spirit's
effusion on humanity, not only in messianic times (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Acts</i>
2:32-36; <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jn</i> 7:39, 20:22; <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">1

</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">The
Second Vatican Council has recalled to the consciousness of the Church's faith
this fundamental truth. In presenting the Father's salvific plan for all
humanity, the Council closely links the mystery of Christ from its very
beginnings with that of the Spirit.<sup>35</sup> The entire work of building the
Church by Jesus Christ the Head, in the course of the centuries, is seen as an
action which he does in communion with his Spirit.<sup>36</sup><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">Furthermore,
the salvific action of Jesus Christ, with and through his Spirit, extends beyond
the visible boundaries of the Church to all humanity. Speaking of the paschal
mystery, in which Christ even now associates the believer to himself in a living
manner in the Spirit and gives him the hope of resurrection, the Council states:
“All this holds true not only for Christians but also for all men of good will
in whose hearts grace is active invisibly. For since Christ died for all, and
since all men are in fact called to one and the same destiny, which is divine,
we must hold that the Holy Spirit offers to all the possibility of being made
partners, in a way known to God, in the paschal mystery”.<sup>37</sup><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">Hence,
the connection is clear between the salvific mystery of the Incarnate Word and
that of the Spirit, who actualizes the salvific efficacy of the Son made man in
the lives of all people, called by God to a single goal, both those who
historically preceded the Word made man, and those who live after his coming in
history: the Spirit of the Father, bestowed abundantly by the Son, is the
animator of all (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jn</i> 3:34).<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">Thus,
the recent Magisterium of the Church has firmly and clearly recalled the truth
of a single divine economy: “The Spirit's presence and activity affect not
only individuals but also society and history, peoples, cultures and
religions... The Risen Christ ‘is now at work in human hearts through the
strength of his Spirit'... Again, it is the Spirit who sows the ‘seeds of the
word' present in various customs and cultures, preparing them for full maturity
in Christ”.<sup>38</sup> While recognizing the historical-salvific function of
the Spirit in the whole universe and in the entire history of humanity,<sup>39</sup>
the Magisterium states: “This is the same Spirit who was at work in the
incarnation and in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus and who is at work
in the Church. He is therefore not an alternative to Christ nor does he fill a
sort of void which is sometimes suggested as existing between Christ and the
Logos. Whatever the Spirit brings about in human hearts and in the history of
peoples, in cultures and religions, serves as a preparation for the Gospel and
can only be understood in reference to Christ, the Word who took flesh by the
power of the Spirit ‘so that as perfectly human he would save all human beings
and sum up all things'”.<sup>40</sup><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">In
conclusion, the action of the Spirit is not outside or parallel to the action of
Christ. There is only one salvific economy of the One and Triune God, realized
in the mystery of the incarnation, death, and resurrection of the Son of God,
actualized with the cooperation of the Holy Spirit, and extended in its salvific
value to all humanity and to the entire universe: “No one, therefore, can
enter into communion with God except through Christ, by the working of the Holy
Spirit”.<sup>41</sup><o:p>

</span>The thesis which denies the unicity and salvific universality of the
mystery of Jesus Christ is also put forward. Such a position has no biblical

fullness and centre, must be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">firmly

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">The
New Testament attests to this fact with clarity: “The Father has sent his Son

4:14); “Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

justify the healing of a man who was crippled from birth, which was done in the
name of Jesus (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Acts</i> 3:1-8),
proclaims: “There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name
under heaven given among men by which we must be saved” (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Acts</i> 4:12). St. Paul adds, moreover, that Jesus Christ “is Lord of
all”, “judge of the living and the dead”, and thus “whoever believes in
him receives forgiveness of sins through his name” (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">Paul,
addressing himself to the community of Corinth, writes: “Indeed, even though
there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth — as in fact there are many
gods and many lords — yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are
all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are
all things and through whom we exist” (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">1
Cor</i> 8:5-6). Furthermore, John the Apostle states: “For God so loved the
world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not
perish but may have eternal life. God did not send his Son into the world to
condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him” (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Jn</i> 3:16-17). In the New Testament, the universal salvific will of
God is closely connected to the sole mediation of Christ: “[God] desires all
men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God;
there is also one mediator between God and men, the man Jesus Christ, who gave
himself as a ransom for all” (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">1 Tim</i>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">It
was in the awareness of the one universal gift of salvation offered by the
Father through Jesus Christ in the Spirit (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Eph</i>
1:3-14), that the first Christians encountered the Jewish people, showing them
the fulfilment of salvation that went beyond the Law and, in the same awareness,
they confronted the pagan world of their time, which aspired to salvation
through a plurality of saviours. This inheritance of faith has been recalled
recently by the Church's Magisterium: “The Church believes that Christ, who
died and was raised for the sake of all (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

strength to be able to respond to his highest calling, nor is there any other
name under heaven given among men by which they can be saved (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Acts</i>

the whole of man's history is to be found in its Lord and Master”.<sup>42</sup><o:p>

in mind this article of faith, theology today, in its reflection on the
existence of other religious experiences and on their meaning in God's salvific
plan, is invited to explore if and in what way the historical figures and
positive elements of these religions may fall within the divine plan of
salvation. In this undertaking, theological research has a vast field of work
under the guidance of the Church's Magisterium.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Second Vatican Council, in fact, has stated that: “the unique
mediation of the Redeemer does not exclude, but rather gives rise to a manifold
cooperation which is but a participation in this one source”.<sup>43</sup> The
content of this participated mediation should be explored more deeply, but must
remain always consistent with the principle of Christ's unique mediation:
“Although participated forms of mediation of different kinds and degrees are
not excluded, they acquire meaning and value <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">only</i> from Christ's own mediation, and they cannot be understood as
parallel or complementary to his”.<sup>44</sup> Hence, those solutions that
propose a salvific action of God beyond the unique mediation of Christ would be
contrary to Christian and Catholic faith.<o:p>

</span>Not infrequently it is proposed that theology should avoid the use of
terms like “unicity”, “universality”, and “absoluteness”, which give
the impression of excessive emphasis on the significance and value of the
salvific event of Jesus Christ in relation to other religions. In reality,
however, such language is simply being faithful to revelation, since it
represents a development of the sources of the faith themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>From the beginning, the community of believers has recognized in Jesus a
salvific value such that he alone, as Son of God made man, crucified and risen,
by the mission received from the Father and in the power of the Holy Spirit,
bestows revelation (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mt</i> 11:27) and
divine life (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jn</i> 1:12; 5:25</span><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">-</span><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">26;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">In
this sense, one can and must say that Jesus Christ has a significance and a
value for the human race and its history, which are unique and singular, proper
to him alone, exclusive, universal, and absolute. Jesus is, in fact, the Word of
God made man for the salvation of all. In expressing this consciousness of
faith, the Second Vatican Council teaches: “The Word of God, through whom all
things were made, was made flesh, so that as perfect man he could save all men
and sum up all things in himself. The Lord is the goal of human history, the
focal point of the desires of history and civilization, the centre of mankind,
the joy of all hearts, and the fulfilment of all aspirations. It is he whom the
Father raised from the dead, exalted and placed at his right hand, constituting
him judge of the living and the dead”.<sup>45</sup> “It is precisely this
uniqueness of Christ which gives him an absolute and universal significance
whereby, while belonging to history, he remains history's centre and goal: ‘I
am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end' (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Rev</i>

the fullness of Christ's salvific mystery belongs also to the Church,

living body, though not identical, are inseparable, so too Christ and the Church
can neither be confused nor separated, and constitute a single “whole
Christ”.<sup>49</sup> This same inseparability is also expressed in the New

Catholic faithful <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">are required to profess</i>
that there is an historical continuity — rooted in the apostolic succession<sup>53</sup>
— between the Church founded by Christ and the Catholic Church: “This is the
single Church of Christ... which our Saviour, after his resurrection, entrusted
to Peter's pastoral care (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jn</i>
21:17), commissioning him and the other Apostles to extend and rule her (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mt</i>

the Catholic Church, governed by the Successor of Peter and by the Bishops in
communion with him”.<sup>54</sup><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With
the expression <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">subsistit in,</i> the
Second Vatican Council sought to harmonize two doctrinal statements: on the one
hand, that the Church of Christ, despite the divisions which exist among
Christians, continues to exist fully only in the Catholic Church, and on the
other hand, that “outside of her structure, many elements can be found of
sanctification and truth”,<sup>55</sup> that is, in those Churches and
ecclesial communities which are not yet in full communion with the Catholic
Church.<sup>56</sup> But with respect to these, it needs to be stated that
“they derive their efficacy from the very fullness of grace and truth
entrusted to the Catholic Church”.<sup>57</sup><o:p>

Catholic Church, governed by the Successor of Peter and by the Bishops in
communion with him.<sup>58</sup> The Churches which, while not existing in
perfect communion with the Catholic Church, remain united to her by means of the
closest bonds, that is, by apostolic succession and a valid Eucharist, are true
particular Churches.<sup>59</sup> Therefore, the Church of Christ is present and
operative also in these Churches, even though they lack full communion with the
Catholic Church, since they do not accept the Catholic doctrine of the Primacy,
which, according to the will of God, the Bishop of Rome objectively has and
exercises over the entire Church.<sup>60</sup><o:p>

the other hand, the ecclesial communities which have not preserved the valid
Episcopate and the genuine and integral substance of the Eucharistic mystery,<sup>61</sup>
are not Churches in the proper sense; however, those who are baptized in these
communities are, by Baptism, incorporated in Christ and thus are in a certain
communion, albeit imperfect, with the Church.<sup>62</sup> Baptism in fact tends
per se toward the full development of life in Christ, through the integral
profession of faith, the Eucharist, and full communion in the Church.<sup>63</sup><o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">“The
Christian faithful are therefore not permitted to imagine that the Church of
Christ is nothing more than a collection — divided, yet in some way one — of
Churches and ecclesial communities; nor are they free to hold that today the
Church of Christ nowhere really exists, and must be considered only as a goal
which all Churches and ecclesial communities must strive to reach”.<sup>64</sup>
In fact, “the elements of this already-given Church exist, joined together in
their fullness in the Catholic Church and, without this fullness, in the other
communities”.<sup>65</sup> “Therefore, these separated Churches and
communities as such, though we believe they suffer from defects, have by no
means been deprived of significance and importance in the mystery of salvation.
For the spirit of Christ has not refrained from using them as means of salvation
which derive their efficacy from the very fullness of grace and truth entrusted

</span>The mission of the Church is “to proclaim and establish among all
peoples the kingdom of Christ and of God, and she is on earth, the seed and the
beginning of that kingdom”.<sup>68</sup> On the one hand, the Church is “a
sacrament — that is, sign and instrument of intimate union with God and of
unity of the entire human race”.<sup>69</sup> She is therefore the sign and
instrument of the kingdom; she is called to announce and to establish the
kingdom. On the other hand, the Church is the “people gathered by the unity of
the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit”;<sup>70</sup> she is therefore “the
kingdom of Christ already present in mystery”<sup>71</sup> and constitutes its
<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">seed</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">beginning.</i>
The kingdom of God, in fact, has an eschatological dimension: it is a reality
present in time, but its full realization will arrive only with the completion
or fulfilment of history.<sup>72</sup><o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">The
meaning of the expressions <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">kingdom of
heaven, kingdom of God</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">kingdom of
Christ</i> in Sacred Scripture and the Fathers of the Church, as well as in the
documents of the Magisterium, is not always exactly the same, nor is their
relationship to the Church, which is a mystery that cannot be totally contained
by a human concept. Therefore, there can be various theological explanations of
these terms. However, none of these possible explanations can deny or empty in
any way the intimate connection between Christ, the kingdom, and the Church. In
fact, the kingdom of God which we know from revelation, “cannot be detached
either from Christ or from the Church... If the kingdom is separated from Jesus,
it is no longer the kingdom of God which he revealed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The result is a distortion of the meaning of the kingdom, which runs the
risk of being transformed into a purely human or ideological goal and a
distortion of the identity of Christ, who no longer appears as the Lord to whom
everything must one day be subjected (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">1
Cor</i> 15:27). Likewise, one may not separate the kingdom from the Church. It
is true that the Church is not an end unto herself, since she is ordered toward
the kingdom of God, of which she is the seed, sign and instrument. Yet, while
remaining distinct from Christ and the kingdom, the Church is indissolubly
united to both”.<sup>73</sup><o:p>

</span>To state the inseparable relationship between Christ and the kingdom is
not to overlook the fact that the kingdom of God — even if considered in its
historical phase — is not identified with the Church in her visible and social
reality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, “the action of
Christ and the Spirit outside the Church's visible boundaries” must not be
excluded.<sup>74</sup> Therefore, one must also bear in mind that “the kingdom
is the concern of everyone: individuals, society and the world. Working for the
kingdom means acknowledging and promoting God's activity, which is present in
human history and transforms it. Building the kingdom means working for
liberation from evil in all its forms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
a word, the kingdom of God is the manifestation and the realization of God's
plan of salvation in all its fullness”.<sup>75</sup><o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">In
considering the relationship between the kingdom of God, the kingdom of Christ,
and the Church, it is necessary to avoid one-sided accentuations, as is the case
with those “conceptions which deliberately emphasize the kingdom and which
describe themselves as ‘kingdom centred.' They stress the image of a Church
which is not concerned about herself, but which is totally concerned with
bearing witness to and serving the kingdom. It is a ‘Church for others,' just
as Christ is the ‘man for others'... Together with positive aspects, these
conceptions often reveal negative aspects as well. First, they are silent about
Christ: the kingdom of which they speak is ‘theocentrically' based, since,
according to them, Christ cannot be understood by those who lack Christian
faith, whereas different peoples, cultures, and religions are capable of finding
common ground in the one divine reality, by whatever name it is called. For the
same reason, they put great stress on the mystery of creation, which is
reflected in the diversity of cultures and beliefs, but they keep silent about
the mystery of redemption. Furthermore, the kingdom, as they understand it, ends
up either leaving very little room for the Church or undervaluing the Church in
reaction to a presumed ‘ecclesiocentrism' of the past and because they
consider the Church herself only a sign, for that matter a sign not without
ambiguity”.<sup>76</sup> These theses are contrary to Catholic faith because
they deny the unicity of the relationship which Christ and the Church have with
the kingdom of God.<o:p>

all else, it must be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">firmly believed</i>
that “the Church, a pilgrim now on earth, is necessary for salvation: the one
Christ is the mediator and the way of salvation; he is present to us in his body
which is the Church. He himself explicitly asserted the necessity of faith and
baptism (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mk</i> 16:16; <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

Church which men enter through baptism as through a door”.<sup>77</sup> This
doctrine must not be set against the universal salvific will of God (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">1
Tim</i> 2:4); “it is necessary to keep these two truths together, namely, the
real possibility of salvation in Christ for all mankind and the necessity of the
Church for this salvation”.<sup>78</sup><o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">The
Church is the “universal sacrament of salvation”,<sup>79</sup> since, united
always in a mysterious way to the Saviour Jesus Christ, her Head, and
subordinated to him, she has, in God's plan, an indispensable relationship with
the salvation of every human being.<sup>80</sup><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>For those who are not formally and visibly members of the Church,
“salvation in Christ is accessible by virtue of a grace which, while having a
mysterious relationship to the Church, does not make them formally part of the
Church, but enlightens them in a way which is accommodated to their spiritual
and material situation. This grace comes from Christ; it is the result of his
sacrifice and is communicated by the Holy Spirit”;<sup>81</sup> it has a
relationship with the Church, which “according to the plan of the Father, has
her origin in the mission of the Son and the Holy Spirit”.<sup>82</sup><o:p>

the Second Vatican Council limited itself to the statement that God bestows it
“in ways known to himself”.<sup>83</sup><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Theologians are seeking to understand this question more fully.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Their work is to be encouraged, since it is certainly useful for
understanding better God's salvific plan and the ways in which it is
accomplished. However, from what has been stated above about the mediation of
Jesus Christ and the “unique and special relationship”<sup>84</sup> which
the Church has with the kingdom of God among men — which in substance is the
universal kingdom of Christ the Saviour — it is clear that it would be
contrary to the faith to consider the Church as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">one
way</i> of salvation alongside those constituted by the other religions, seen as
complementary to the Church or substantially equivalent to her, even if these
are said to be converging with the Church toward the eschatological kingdom of
God.<o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">Certainly,
the various religious traditions contain and offer religious elements which come
from God,<sup>85</sup> and which are part of what “the Spirit brings about in
human hearts and in the history of peoples, in cultures, and religions”.<sup>86</sup>
Indeed, some prayers and rituals of the other religions may assume a role of
preparation for the Gospel, in that they are occasions or pedagogical helps in
which the human heart is prompted to be open to the action of God.<sup>87</sup>
One cannot attribute to these, however, a divine origin or an <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ex
opere operato</i> salvific efficacy, which is proper to the Christian
sacraments.<sup>88</sup> Furthermore, it cannot be overlooked that other
rituals, insofar as they depend on superstitions or other errors (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">1
Cor</i> 10:20-21), constitute an obstacle to salvation.<sup>89</sup><o:p>

</span>With the coming of the Saviour Jesus Christ, God has willed that the
Church founded by him be the instrument for the salvation of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">all</i>
humanity (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Acts</i> 17:30</span><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">-</span><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">31).<sup>90</sup>
This truth of faith does not lessen the sincere respect which the Church has for
the religions of the world, but at the same time, it rules out, in a radical
way, that mentality of indifferentism “characterized by a religious relativism
which leads to the belief that ‘one religion is as good as another'”.<sup>91</sup>
If it is true that the followers of other religions can receive divine grace, it
is also certain that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">objectively speaking</i>
they are in a gravely deficient situation in comparison with those who, in the
Church, have the fullness of the means of salvation.<sup>92</sup><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, “all the children of the Church should nevertheless remember
that their exalted condition results, not from their own merits, but from the
grace of Christ. If they fail to respond in thought, word, and deed to that
grace, not only shall they not be saved, but they shall be more severely
judged”.<sup>93</sup> One understands then that, following the Lord's command
(cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mt</i> 28:19</span><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">-</span><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">20)
and as a requirement of her love for all people, the Church “proclaims and is
in duty bound to proclaim without fail, Christ who is the way, the truth, and
the life (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jn</i> 14:6). In him, in whom
God reconciled all things to himself (cf. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">2

</span>“Indeed, God ‘desires all men to be saved and come to the knowledge
of the truth' (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">1 Tim</i> 2:4); that is,
God wills the salvation of everyone through the knowledge of the truth.
Salvation is found in the truth. Those who obey the promptings of the Spirit of
truth are already on the way of salvation. But the Church, to whom this truth
has been entrusted, must go out to meet their desire, so as to bring them the
truth. Because she believes in God's universal plan of salvation, the Church

which is a presupposition of inter</span><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">-</span><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">religious
dialogue, refers to the equal personal dignity of the parties in dialogue, not
to doctrinal content, nor even less to the position of Jesus Christ — who is
God himself made man — in relation to the founders of the other religions.
Indeed, the Church, guided by charity and respect for freedom,<sup>98</sup> must
be primarily committed to proclaiming to all people the truth definitively
revealed by the Lord, and to announcing the necessity of conversion to Jesus
Christ and of adherence to the Church through Baptism and the other sacraments,
in order to participate fully in communion with God, the Father, Son and Holy
Spirit. Thus, the certainty of the universal salvific will of God does not
diminish, but rather increases the duty and urgency of the proclamation of
salvation and of conversion to the Lord Jesus Christ.<o:p>

the example of the Apostle Paul, who wrote to the faithful of Corinth: “I
handed on to you as of first importance what I myself received” (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">1

theological reflection is called to reconfirm the Church's faith and to give
reasons for her hope in a way that is convincing and effective.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-hyphenate: none" align="left"><span lang="IT" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;letter-spacing:-.15pt">In
treating the question of the true religion, the Fathers of the Second Vatican
Council taught: “We believe that this one true religion continues to exist in
the Catholic and Apostolic Church, to which the Lord Jesus entrusted the task of
spreading it among all people. Thus, he said to the Apostles: ‘Go therefore
and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have
commanded you' (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mt</i> 28: 19-20).
Especially in those things that concern God and his Church, all persons are
required to seek the truth, and when they come to know it, to embrace it and
hold fast to it”.<sup>99</sup><o:p>

revelation of Christ will continue to be “the true lodestar”<sup> 100</sup>
in history for all humanity: “The truth, which is Christ, imposes itself as an
all-embracing authority”.<sup> 101</sup> The Christian mystery, in fact,
overcomes all barriers of time and space, and accomplishes the unity of the
human family: “From their different locations and traditions all are called in
Christ to share in the unity of the family of God's children... Jesus destroys
the walls of division and creates unity in a new and unsurpassed way through our
sharing in his mystery. This unity is so deep that the Church can say with Saint
Paul: ‘You are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are saints and
members of the household of God' (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Eph</i>
